    In the beginning, I had already implement new_line, three_line s, nine_lines, and clear_screen functions and also in the section I had also called the function which is given below :

def new_line():
  print()
def three_lines():
  new_lines()
  new_lines()
  new_lines()
def nine_lines():
  three_lines()
  three_lines()
  three_lines()
print("first line has been explained.") 
print("its time for total nine blank lines....!")
print("second line also been described.")
def clear_screen():
  nine_lines()
  nine_lines()
  three_lines()
  three_lines()
  new_line()
print("line one ")
print("here is twenty-five blank lines has been added...!")
print("this is last line")


    Secondly, in my assignment, I had already demonstrated the uses of nested function calls which is known as clear_screen in the function definition. 



   Thirdly, in my assignments, my output has  been executed which is given below:

first line has been explained.
its time for total nine blank lines....!
second line also been described.
line one 
here is twenty-five blank lines has been added...!
this is last line
 
     In my output when I used this method I do not have any error in my console, but when in try to add clear_screen at last and try to run its this method would cause an error,



def new_line():
  print()
def three_lines():
  new_lines()
  new_lines()
  new_lines()
def nine_lines():
  three_lines()
  three_lines()
  three_lines()
print("first line has been explained.") 
print("its time for total nine blank lines....!")
print("second line also been described.")
def clear_screen():
  nine_lines()
  nine_lines()
  three_lines()
  three_lines()
  new_line()
print("line one ")
print("here is twenty-five blank lines has been added...!")
clear_screen()
print("this is last line")
Output:

first line has been explained.
its time for total nine blank lines....!
second line also been described.
line one 
here is twenty-five blank lines has been added...!

 Because I am not printing clear_screen and I am not getting 25 lines and 9 line script print properly as it cause a syntax error. When removing that line my output does not show any syntax error.

   Fourthly, Now I am going to add comments in the appropriate place in my program,


def new_line(): # this is testable 
  print()
def three_lines(): # defining 3 lines
  new_lines()
  new_lines()
  new_lines()
def nine_lines(): # defining 9 line
  three_lines()
  three_lines()
  three_lines()
print("first line has been explained.") 
print("its time for total nine blank lines....!")
print("second line also been described.")
def clear_screen(): #trying to print 25 line clear_screen
  nine_lines()
  nine_lines()
  three_lines()
  three_lines()
  new_line()
print("line one ")
print("here is twenty-five blank lines has been added...!")
# clear_screen()
print("this is last line")
