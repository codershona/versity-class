The correct answer is: The order in which statements are executed during a program run. → flow of execution, The first part of a compound statement begins with a keyword and ends with a colon ( : ) → header, A statement that executes a function. It consists of the name of the function followed by a list of arguments enclosed in parentheses. → function call, A variable defined inside a function that can only be used inside its function. → local variable, A graphical representation of functions, their variables, and the values to which they refer. → stack diagram
