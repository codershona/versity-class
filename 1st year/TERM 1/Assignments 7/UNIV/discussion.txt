ANSWER: 


   Stress management is a very effective matter in our daily life because taking stress affected us psychologically, physically, and mentally. For example, if I always take 10 minutes morning walk this would help me to reduce my daily life work stress and lessen the endorphins in the system. By practicing mindfulness, also help us to keep focus and learn new things and take a chill breath after completing all overloaded work. Another option is Organizing myself as a useful trick to maintain for me. For example, if I spend some time setting up my daily life planner, I could straightly follow my planners and works and complete all tasks on time.  This would help me to rule out the disorder in my health. Besides this, by creating a reflection journal would help us in many ways.

By writing our own thoughts and views and keep process to complete all this help us to keep the fresh and clear expectation of our situation. 

    In my second point, using reframing and improving our daily planner would assist us to reduce our stress and help us to keep ourself on how to complete work by using a time planer and get time for our relaxation. By managing strength imbalance is also another signature key of strengths. It would help us to develop our forgiving styles and practice our mind. By using a positive self-affirmation as well as write down all about what I want to enjoy after complete all tasks help to keep our self-esteem and keep positive.
