CS 2301 Operating Systems 1 - AY2021-T5

Syllabus

Prerequisites: None.

Course Description: The course Operating Systems I is the first of two courses designed to explain the intricacies of modern operating systems to the students. Throughout this course, students will be learning about the basic structure of an operating system in detail. There are the three key ideas we’re going to learn about over the course of OS1 and OS2: virtualization, concurrency, and persistence. In learning about these ideas, we’ll learn all about how an operating system works, including how it decides what program to run next on a CPU, how it handles memory overload in a virtual memory system, how virtual machine monitors work, how to manage information on disks, and even a little about how to build a distributed system that works when parts of them have failed.  OS1 will focus entirely on the Windows O/S and Virtualization. OS2 will continue with the concepts of concurrency, and persistence and focus on the Linux operating system.
