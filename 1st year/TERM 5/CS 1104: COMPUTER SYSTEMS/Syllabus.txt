CS 1104 Computer Systems - AY2021-T5
Syllabus

Prerequisites:  CS 1103 Programming 2


Course Description:

This course is an introduction to computer systems. In this course, we will begin by exploring the internal design and functionality of the most basic computer components. From there, we will use an online hardware simulator to actually “build” a computer and develop an assembler from the ground using concepts we will learn in the class. In the process, we will cover the ideas and techniques used in the design of modern computer hardware and discuss major trade-offs involved in system design as well as future trends in computer architecture and how those trends might affect tomorrow’s computers.


Required Textbook and Materials:

UoPeople courses use open educational resources (OER) and other materials specifically donated to the University with free permissions for educational use. Therefore, students are not required to purchase any textbooks or sign up for any websites that have a cost associated with them. The main required textbooks for this course are listed below and can be readily accessed using the provided links. There may be additional required/recommended readings, supplemental materials, or other resources and websites necessary for lessons; these will be provided for you in the course's General Information and Forums area, and throughout the term via the weekly course Unit areas and the Learning Guides.

For each unit, the relevant chapters of the textbook will be accessible from the unit Learning Guide and from the unit section of the course homepage.

Software Requirements/Installation

This course will require the use of two software packages.  Both require that your computer have a Java v1.5 JRE (Java Run Time) installed.  They are available from the following:

Logism: Logism is an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits. It is available from: Burch, C. (2005). Getting Logism. Logism. http://www.cburch.com/logisim/download.html

TECS Software Suite:  The TECS Software suite is the companion software to the Nisan and Schocken text "The Elements of Computing Systems" it is available from: Schocken, S., & Nisan, N. (2017). Software. From Nand to Tetris. http://www.nand2tetris.org/software.php
