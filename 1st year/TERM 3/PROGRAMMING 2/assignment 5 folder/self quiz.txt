Which of these statements is true?

A:a. The hash code of an object is an integer that tells where that object should be stored in a hash table.

b. A hash table is an array of linked lists. When an object is stored in a hash table, it is added to one of these linked lists.

c. The object's hash code is the index of the position in the array where the object is stored.

d. All objects with the same hash code go into the same linked list.

e. In Java, every object obj has a method obj.hashCode() that is used to compute hash codes for the object.

f. If the object is to be stored in a hash table of size N, then the hash code that is used for the object is Math.abs(obj.hashCode())%N.
Select one or more:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.






Which of the data types below does not allow duplicates?

A: d. Set


Which of the following data types do not have iterators?

A:c. Map


Given the following code:

public class Test {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
     Map map = new HashMap();
     map.put("123", "John Smith");
     map.put("111", "George Smith");
     map.put("123", "Steve Yao");
     map.put("222", "Steve Yao");
   }
}
Which statement is correct?


A:b. After all the four entries are added to the map, "123" is a key that corresponds to the value "Steve Yao".

You can use the methods in the Collections class to:

A: a. find the maximum object in a collection based on the compareTo method.
b. find the maximum object in a collection using a Comparator object.


The Collection interface is the base interface for …

A: a. Set
b. List
c. ArrayList
d. LinkedList



The Map is the base interface for …

A: a. TreeMap
b. HashMap
c. LinkedHashMap



Which of the following statements are true?


A: a. The Collection interface is the root interface for manipulating a collection of objects.
b. The Collection interface provides the basic operations for adding and removing elements in a collection.
c. The AbstractCollection class is a convenience class that provides partial implementation for the Collection interface.
d. Some of the methods in the Collection interface cannot be implemented in the concrete subclass. In this case, the method would throw java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException, a subclass of RuntimeException.
e. All interfaces and classes in the Collections framework are declared using generic type in JDK 1.5.



To store non-duplicated objects in the order in which they are inserted, use ….


A: b. LinkedHashSet


Which of the following statements are true?

A: a. The Comparable interface contains the compareTo method with the signature "public int compareTo(Object)".
b. The Comparator interface contains the compare method with the signature "public int compare(Object, Object)".
c. A Comparable object can compare this object with the other object.
d. A Comparator object contains the compare method that compares two objects.




Which of the following statements are true?

A: a. An ArrayList can grow automatically.
c. You can reduce the capacity of an ArrayList by invoking the trimToSize() method on the list.
