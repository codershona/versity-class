Which of these statements is true?

Which of the following statements describe a client/server model ?
A: a. Computer transactions using the client/server model are very common.c. Although the client/server idea can be used by programs within a single computer, it is a more important idea in a network.

BufferedImage OSC = new BufferedImage(32,32,BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);

A: a. A BufferedImage is a region in memory that can be used as a drawing surface.
b. In this statement, the image that is created is 32 pixels wide and 32 pixels high, and the color of each pixel is an RGB color that has red, green, and blue components in the range 0 to 255.
c. The picture in a BufferedImage can easily be copied into a graphics context g by calling one of the g.drawImage methods.
d. The image drawn here is so small, it seems likely that is going to be used to define an ImageIcon.

Given the following code:

public class Test {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
     Map map = new HashMap();
     map.put("123", "John Smith");
     map.put("111", "George Smith");
     map.put("123", "Steve Yao");
