A: a. The Fibonacci series begins with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the preceding two numbers in the series.


Given the following piece of code:

class Student { public void talk(){} }
public class Test{
          public static void main(String args[]){
                    Student t = null;
                    try {
                           t.talk();
                           } catch(NullPointerException e){
                                   System.out.print("There is a NullPointerException. ");
                           } catch(Exception e){
                                   System.out.print("There is an Exception. ");
                           }
                           System.out.print("Everything ran fine. ");
          }
}

what will be the result?

a. If you run this program, the following is printed:
There is a NullPointerException. Everything ran fine.

b. If you run this program, the following is printed:
There is a NullPointerException.

c. If you run this program, the following is printed:
There is a NullPointerException. There is an Exception.

d. This code will not compile, because in Java there are no pointers.


A: a.


To declare a class named A with a generic type, use

a. public class A<E> { ... }
b. public class A<E, F> { ... }
c. public class A(E) { ... }
d. public class A(E, F) { ... }


A: a.
