Lines can be used to approximate a wide variety of functions; often a function can be described using many lines.

If a stock price goes from $10 to $12 from January 1st to January 31, from $12 to $9 from February 1st to February 28th, and from $9 to $15 from March 1st to March 31th is the price change from $10 to $15 a straight line? 

It is clear that in each of the three time intervals mentioned there was a complex daily variation of prices as in an electrocardiogram. But what would be a simplified solution for a first naive view of the situation? Would a simple function hold up? What is the simplest function to represent this situation? Does your naïve initial and simplified model allow you to predict the behavior of the stock in the next month?

How can I use three “pieces” of lines to describe the price movements from the beginning of January to the end of March? Show the graph for the price movement.

Go to www.desmos.com/calculator, and write your equations following the example

y = x + 2    {0 < x < 2}

y = –x + 6  {2 < x < 5}

y = 2x – 9  {5 < x < 8}  



ANSWER:

  In the beginning, If I check I would get the price which was changed from 10 dollars on 1st January to 15 dollars on 31st March and this was not a straight line. The reason is for the value of the stocks has been increased after that it again decreased furthermore it had been again increased gradually. Besides this, the simplest function needs to be modelled bu the data which needs to connected the line from the first to last data point. For instance, x equal to 1 (x = 1) that was similar to 1st January within 10 dollars price. On the other hand, (x = 90) will also be resembling with 31st March which has 15 dollars price. These might have a model with a line consists of 2 points by using the 'Slope Form', 

(y−10) = 15−10 / 89(x−1)
y = (5/89)x + (885/89)


  Explanation, it was a well model but the purpose was for the behaviour for the stock prices which was generally not linear. The model was for the oncoming predictions. In this case, the projections were quite strict for the mathematical extrapolation as well as these do not have the right state for the assets. If I predict for the 30th April I might get, y(120) ≈ $16.69. 

 But if I three lines to show in the graph which was the interval for the three months. 

January: 1 ≤ x ≤ 311 ≤ x ≤ 31 conjunctive with (1,10) aa well as (31,12)
(y−10) = { 1 / 15(x−1) }


February: 32 ≤ x ≤ 59 conjunctive with (32,12) as well as (59,9)
(y−12) = { −1/9(x−32) }
March : 60 ≤ x ≤ 90 connecting with (60,9) or (90,15)

(y−9) = { 1/5(x−60) }



   



     Finally, Yes, the simple function would need to hold up and the naïve initial, as well as the simplified model, also needs to be allowed for the prediction of the behaviour of the stock in the next month.
