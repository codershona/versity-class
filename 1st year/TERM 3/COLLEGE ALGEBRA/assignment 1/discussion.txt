Consider the equation  x^2+(y-2)^2=1 and the relation “(x, y) R (0, 2)”, where R is read as “has distance 1 of”. 

For example, “(0, 3) R (0, 2)”, that is, “(0, 3) has distance 1 of (0, 2)”. This relation can also be read as “the point (x, y) is on the circle of radius 1 with center (0, 2)”. In other words: “(x, y) satisfies this equation x^2+(y-2)^2=1, if and only if, (x, y) R (0, 2)”. 

Does this equation determine a relation between x and y? Can the variable x can be seen as a function of y, like x=g(y)? Can the variable y be expressed as a function of x, like y= h(x)? If these are possible, then what will be the domains for these two functions?  What are the graphs of these two functions? 

Are there points of the coordinate axes that relate to (0, 2) by means of R?

ANSWER:   In the beginning, here my answer is yes. I am using an affirmative response. Here I am going to describe the relationship between x as well as y. Namely, we could say that x, as well as y, is going to be chosen by the form of a circle with a radius of the unit. Consequently, I could also illustrate that x, as well as y, would be connected with each and other. For Instance, 
( x − c )2 + ( y − d)2  = 1 otherwise, ( c, d ) would be the centre of these circles.  In case, ( c, d ) would be ( 0, 2 ) moreover, ( x2 + ( y − 2 )2 = 1.

   Afterwards, 

         x = g( y ) = ±√(1 - ( y - 2 )2 )  

Explanation, these was the connection between the presented dependency of the x as well as y.



  In my second point of the view, y = h( x ) = ±√(1 -  x2  + 2).  Explanation, the domain for the g( y ) will be [ 0, 3 ] kind of y would be the value of x that will be true. On the other hand,  the domain for the h(x) will be going to be [ 0, 1 ]. As a result, the point of the ( 0, 2 ) will be connected with the R functions that would be shown as the circle for the unit of the radius. 



 Thirdly, the graphs those two functions would not be the graph and the graph will be the circle connected with the center of (0,2) as well as the radius of 1.  

   

   Finally, my primary illustration is the equation of the determine within a connection between x and y  that would be x2+ ( y-2 )2= 1. Here the circle will be the radius of 1 as well as the centre of 0, 2. Secondarily, the variable would be x that could be shown for the function of y, as well as y be seen as the function of x where is outcome would be x2 = (1 - ( y - 2 )2)  

x = ±√( 1 - ( y - 2 )2) ( y - 2 )2 = 1 - x2  y - 2 = ±√( 1 - x2 ) y = 2 ±√( 1 - x2 ).

In my fifth point, every points of the circle could be the distance with 1 on the center of ( 0, 2 ) as well as radius will be only 1.
