Consider the following study: We want to know the average amount of money first year college students spend at NDD College on accessories. We randomly survey 22 first year students at the college. Four out of the 22 students spent $33, $110, $180, and $197, respectively. The target parameter of this survey is:

d. The average amount of money spent by all first year students of the college.


Consider the following relative frequency table on hurricanes that have made direct hits on the U.S. between 1851 and 2004. Hurricanes are given a strength category rating based on the minimum wind speed generated by the storm. (http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gifs/table5.gif ) (ALTERNATE DOWNLOAD LINK)

Frequency of Hurricane Direct Hits
Category	# Direct Hits	Relative Freq.	Cum. Relative Freq.
1	109	0.3993	0.3993
2	72	0.2637	 
3	71	0.2601	 
4	18	 	0.9890
5	3	0.0110	1.0000
The relative frequency of direct hits that were at most category 2 storm is: (The answer may be rounded up to 3 decimal places of the actual value.)


ANSWER: 0.663


Consider the following data:
4.4, 5.3, 4.4, 2.8, 0.9, 6.1, 3.0, 8.6, 10.7, 4.3, 1.9, 12.0, 5.9, 4.8, 7.7

The sample variance is equal to (the answer may be rounded up to 3 decimal places of the actual value):

Answer:


Complete the probabilities of the random variable Y in above table. The expectation of Y is equal to
Answer: 10.36

Meiosis is the process in which a diploid cell that contains two copies of the genetic material produces an haploid cell with only one copy (sperms and eggs). The resulting molecule of genetic material is linear molecule that is composed of consecutive segments: a segment that originated from one of the two copies followed by a segment from the other copy and vice versa. The border points between segments are called points of crossover. The Haldane model for crossovers states that the number of crossovers between two loci on the genome has a Poisson(λ) distribution. Assume that the expected number of crossovers between two loci is 0.66. The probability of obtaining at most 1 crossovers between the two loci is (The answer may be rounded up to 3 decimal places of the actual value.)

Answer: 0.8579732

The patient recovery time from a particular surgical procedure is Normally distributed with a mean of 9.3 days and a standard deviation of 3.5 days. The probability of spending between 5 to 10 days in recovery is: (The answer may be rounded up to 3 decimal places of the actual value.)


ANSWER: 0.4696434


It is claimed that the expected length of time some computer part may work before requiring a reboot is 26 days. In order to examine this claim 80 identical parts are set to work. Assume that the distribution of the length of time the part can work (in days) is Exponential. The central region that contains 70% of the distribution of the average is of the form E(X) ± c, where E(X) is the expectation of the sample average. The value of c is (You are asked to apply the Normal approximation to the distribution of the average of the 80 parts that are examined. The answer may be rounded up to 3 decimal places of the actual value.)
