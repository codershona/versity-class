Recall that the population average of the heights in the file "pop1.csv" is μ = 170.035. Using simulations we found that the probability of the sample average of the height falling within 1 centimeter of the population average is approximately equal to 0.626. From the simulations we also got that the standard deviation of the sample average is (approximately) equal to 1.122. In the next 3 questions you are asked to apply the Normal approximation to the distribution of the sample average using this information. The answer may be rounded up to 3 decimal places of the actual value:

According to the Internal Revenue Service, the average length of time for an individual to complete (record keep, learn, prepare, copy, assemble and send) IRS Form 1040 is 10.53 hours (without any attached schedules). The distribution is unknown. Let us assume that the standard deviation is 2 hours. Suppose we randomly sample 36 taxpayers and compute their average time to completing the forms. Then the probability that the average is more than 11 hours is approximately equal to (The answer may be rounded up to 3 decimal places of the actual value.)

A switching board receives a random number of phone calls. The expected number of calls is 5.3 per minute. Assume that the distribution of the number of calls is Poisson. The average number of calls per minute is recorded by counting the total number of calls received in one hour, divided by 60, the number of minutes in an hour.
