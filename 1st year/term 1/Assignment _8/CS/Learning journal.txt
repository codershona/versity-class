Modify your program from Learning Journal Unit 7 to read dictionary items from a file and write the inverted dictionary to a file. You will need to decide on the following:

How to format each dictionary item as a text string in the input file.
How to covert each input string into a dictionary item.
How to format each item of your inverted dictionary as a text string in the output file.
Create an input file with your original three-or-more items and add at least three new items, for a total of at least six items.


Include the following in your Learning Journal submission: 

The input file for your original dictionary (with at least six items).
The Python program to read from a file, invert the dictionary, and write to a different file.
The output file for your inverted dictionary.
A description of how you chose to encode the original dictionary and the inverted dictionary in text files.



ANSWER:             In the beginning, Python file handling is the most effective part of web application development. As it has several functions suppose creating, reading, updating, and deleting files. It has a key to the function which works in the files called the open() function. This function has two parameters, which are called filename as well as the node. 

  I am going to write the format of each dictionary item as a text string in the input file and that is given below:

file_item = {
  'File 1': 6,
  'File 2': 89,
  'File 3': 99
}
with open('file_string', 'a+' ) as f:
  for key, value in file_item.items():
    f.write(f'{key}:{value}\n')


  ANSWER 2:  Secondly, I am going to convert each input string into a dictionary item, and here is my code:

def file_item():
  filename = input('Enter filename, split key and the value').split(':')
  if len(filename) != 2 or not filename[0] or not filename[1]:
    print('Enter the correct filename')
    return file_item()
    file_name_string = {filename[0]: filename[1]}
    print(file_name_string)
    file_item()


ANSWER 3: Thirdly, I am going to format each item of your inverted dictionary as a text string in the output file and my method is given below:

with open('file_item') as f:
  data = dict()
  for i in f.readlines():
    if i != '\n':
      item = i.split(':')
      data[item[0]] = item[1].strip()
      print(data)

ANSWER 4:  In my fourth point, I am going to create an input file with your original three-or-more items and add at least three new items, for a total of at least six items and this is given below:

with open('new_file', 'x') as b:
  b.write('Toyota:10000\n'
  'Tesla:678\n'
  'Lamborghini:200\n')
with open('new)file', 'a+') as x:
  x.write('Porschi:300\n'
  'Customvan:200\n'
  'Honda:4\n')
