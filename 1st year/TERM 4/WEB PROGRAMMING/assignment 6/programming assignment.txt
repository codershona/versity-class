Exercise 1:

Write an XML document describing the exercises in this document: the root element is <exercises>. The root has an attribute number that has value 1. The root element has three child elements; <date> that contains as text the date of the exercise, and two <item> elements for the first two exercises (1--2). Write some text in the <item> elements.

Exercise 2:

Write an XML document describing a person: name, occupation, address and hobbies. Please do not use your own information, you can use fake data.  Decide on suitable element names and nesting. Check your document for well-formedness.


Exercise 3:

Draw a tree that represents the XML document you created in task 2.



Exercise 4:

This is the books.xml file

<?xml version='1.0'?>
<!-- This file represents a fragment of a book store inventory database -->
<bookstore>

Using books.xml as a model, create a small xml file for a student's program of study form called programOfStudy.xml. It should capture the following data:

In the Fall 2008 semester the student plans to take two classes to satisfy her General Education requirements, PHIL 101 to satisfy Goal 8 and ECON 201 to satisfy Goal 11. She also has to take one core course, MGT 217, and two major courses, CIS 120 and CIS 403.
In the Spring 2009 semester she plans to take two additional core courses, MGT 261 and MKTG 325, as well as three major courses, CIS 220, CIS 407, and CIS 490.




ANSWER: 
In the beginning, I am going to discuss the exercise 1 according to the question, 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?>  
<exercise> 
       <date>16-05-2021</date> 
       <item1>Here I am discuss about reading the about of XML</item1>  
       <item2>Now I am practicing the XML</item2>  
<item3>This is item number three XML</item3>
  </exercise>
<exercise id="exercise_two">
<date>15-05-2021</date>
<item1>Reading the about of XML</item1>
<item2>Practicing the XML</item2>
<item3>This is item number three XML</item3>
</exercise>

In my second point of the view, I am going to discuss the exercise 2 which is given below, 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<person> 
  <name> 
    <firstname>Dianna</firstname> 
    <lastname>Gomes</lastname> 
  </name> 
<occupation>Web Programmer</occupation> 
  <address> 
    <street1>2050 Downing Town Street</street1> 
    <street2>Norsborg</street2> 
    <suburb>Botkyra</suburb> 
    <city>Stockholm</city> 
    <province>Sweden</province> 
    <postalcode>133333</postalcode> 
    <country>Sweden</country> 
  </address> 
<hobbies> 
  <hobby>Travelling</hobby> 
  <hobby>Learning new things</hobby> 
  <hobby>Coding</hobby> 
<hobby>Cooking</hobby>
</hobbies> 
</person> 


In my third point of view, I am going to draw a tree that represents the XML document you created in task 2,






In my forth point of the view, here I am attaching the code in programOfStudy.xml but still i am writing the demo code as pre-format style for my peer can easily view it. 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
         <!-- here I had outline the program of study of a student --> 
  <programofstudy> 
    <program year="2008" semester="FALL"> 
      <class> 
        <course1> Web programming 1 <coursecode>(PHIL 101)</coursecode></course1> 
        <goal> 8 </goal> 
        <course2>Database 1 <coursecode> ECON 201 </coursecode></course2> 
        <goal> 11 </goal> 
      </class> 
  <core> MGT 217 </core> 
  <major> 
    <course1>Operating Systems 1 <coursecode> CIS 120 </coursecode></course1> 
    <course2> Computer Systems 1 <coursecode> CIS 403 </coursecode></course2> 
  </major> 
  </program> 
 <program year="2008" semester="SPRING"> 
   <core1> Programming 1 <coursecode> MGT 261 </coursecode></core1> 
   <core2> Programming 2 <coursecode> MKTG 325 </coursecode></core2>
<major>
       <course1> Software Engineering 1 <coursecode> CIS 220 </coursecode></course1> 
       <course2> College Algebra <coursecode> CIS 407 </coursecode> </course2> 
       <course3> Introduction to Statistics <coursecode> CIS 490 </coursecode></course3> 
   </major> 
</program> 
</programofstudy>


NOTE : Besides this check my file attachment also. Please I request my peer do not grade randomly without checking my attachment file. I had attched the programOfStudy.xml file in my attachment.
