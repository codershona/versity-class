In Figure A you will find box plots for three sets of data. In Figure B are the histograms for the same sets of data, but in a different order. Associate each box plot with its relative histogram.
 Figure A:


 ANS: Histogram b, a, c


 Consider the box plots in Figure A. Which of the data has a smaller inter-quartile range (IQR)?



Figure A

For the next 3 question deal with the following data:
11.9, 11.0, 12.4, 16.9, 16.3, 13.3, 9.1, 17.0, 11.0, 9.3, 25.3, 17.4, 17.4


The median is equal to:


ANS: b. 13.3


The largest value in the data is an outlier:

ANS: false


The smallest value in the data is an outlier:
Select one:
a. false
