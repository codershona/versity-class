APA Exercise
Every week in your learning journal for Online Education Strategies, you will practice APA format. This week, you are going to learn how to cite a webpage. Find a webpage related to this week’s peer review exercise on water pollution. Then, complete the following exercise:

What is the title of the webpage?
Who is the author (or who are the authors)? Note: an author can also be an organization. The Center for Disease Control is an example of an organization that is the author of a webpage.
What year was the webpage published? Note: if there is no date, you can write “n.d.” instead.
What is the URL of the webpage?
Using the information from #1-4, write the APA reference for the webpage you found. The reference goes at the end of your work, after all of your writing is finished.
Now, let’s write the in-text citation, to use at the end of a sentence you are writing. In-text citations are always (Author, Year). Using the information from #5, write the APA in-text citation for the webpage you found.
