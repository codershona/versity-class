This week's assignment is Part 1 of Lab 3, "Recursive Syntax".


ANSWER:

/*
  The last verse of a well-known nursery rhyme:

    This is the farmer sowing his corn
    That kept the rooster that crowed in the morn
    That waked the judge all shaven and shorn
    That married the man all tattered and torn
    That kissed the maiden all forlorn
    That milked the cow with the crumpled horn
    That tossed the dog 
    That worried the cat
    That chased the rat
    That ate the cheese
    That lay in the house that Jack built. 

  Some rules that capture the syntax of this verse:

    <sentence> ::= <simple_sentence> [ and <sentence> ]

    <simple_sentence> ::=  this is [ <noun_phrase> ] the house that Jack built

    <noun_phrase> ::= the <noun> [ <modifier> ] that <verb> [ <noun_phrase> ]

    <noun> ::= farmer | rooster | judge | man | maiden | cow | dog | cat | cheese

    <verb> ::= kept | waked | married | milked | tossed | chased | lay in

    <modifier> ::= that crowed in the morn | all shaven and shorn |
                    all tattered and torn | all forlorn | with the crumpled horn

  This program implements these rules to generate random sentences.  All the
  verses of the rhyme can be generated, plus a lot of sentences that make no
  sense (but still follow the syntax).   Note that an optional item like
  [ <modifier> ] has a chance of being used, depending on the value of some
  randomly generated number.

  The program generates and outputs one random sentence every three seconds until
  it is halted (for example, by typing Control-C in the terminal window where it is
  running).

	static void randomSimpleSentence() {

		System.out.print("this is ");
		if (Math.random() > 0.15) { // 85% of sentences have a noun phrase. 
			randomNounPhrase();
		}
		System.out.print("the house that Jack built");
	}

	/**

		/* A random noun. */
		
		int n = (int)(Math.random()*nouns.length);
		System.out.print("the " + nouns[n]);
		
		/* Optionally, a modifier. */
		
		if (Math.random() > 0.75) { // 25% chance of having a modifier.
			int m = (int)(Math.random()*modifiers.length);
			System.out.print(" " + modifiers[m]);
		}
		
		/* "that", followed by a random verb */
		
		int v = (int)(Math.random()*verbs.length);

		/* Another random noun phrase */

Or,


In the beginning, I am going to illustrate my unit 2 programming assignments which are for Part 1 in Lab 3 and the topic is recursive syntax.

Explanation of my code,

Here, the last verse will be the well-known nursery rhyme:

    This is the farmer sowing his corn
    That kept the rooster that crowed in the morn
    That waked the judge all shaven and shorn
    That married the man all tattered and torn
    That kissed the maiden all forlorn
    That milked the cow with the crumpled horn
    That tossed the dog 
    That worried the cat
    That chased the rat
    That ate the cheese
    That lay in the house that Jack built. 

  These rules needs to be captured by the syntax of 'this' verse:

    <sentence> ::= <simple_sentence> [ and <sentence> ]

    <simple_sentence> ::=  this is [ <noun_phrase> ] the house that Jack built

    <noun_phrase> ::= the <noun> [ <modifier> ] that <verb> [ <noun_phrase> ]

    <noun> ::= farmer | rooster | judge | man | maiden | cow | dog | cat | cheese

    <verb> ::= kept | waked | married | milked | tossed | chased | lay in

    <modifier> ::= that crowed in the morn | all shaven and shorn |
                    all tattered and torn | all forlorn | with the crumpled horn

   So, the program needs to imply the rules for the random sentences and the verses for the rhyme could be created by the random sentence in this case, it couls had much sentences to make the sense otherwise this could still follow those syntax. 
   Notes: If the optional has an item which has a sense that called [ <modifier> ] needs to be used and depend for the value of the random generated number. These program would be made by the ouputs of each random sentence for all three seconds up to it has been halted by typing the Control + C keys in my terminal console which was running while I am wrtiing my code.
