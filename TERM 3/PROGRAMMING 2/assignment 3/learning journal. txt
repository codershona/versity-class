Learning Journal Unit 3
The Learning Journal is a place where you can reflect on your learning throughout the course. There will also be assigned tasks to complete in your Learning Journal, for example, compiling vocabulary lists of unfamiliar words in required readings, summarizing articles, and engaging in self-reflection on assignments.


The Learning Journal comprises 10% of your Final Grade. You will be assessed on the consistency with which you update the journal, the quality of your self-reflection, and whether you complete assigned tasks. For this reason, it is necessary that you date each entry and use clear titles and sub-headings. Note that only you and your instructor will have access to the Learning Journal.


ANSWER:


In the beginning, I want to reflect my this week's learning process which I had been followed throughout this course.  This week I had time to complete my tasks from 11th February to 17th February. This was about unit three and the chapter was ADTs, Stacks, and Queues. At first, I had been complete the self-quiz on 12th February. There were nearly nine multiple-choice and all of my answers were correct. After completing the self-quiz I had started giving this week's grade quiz exam which would be added to my final grades. I am very happy that I had got 100 out of 100 on my grade quiz. Next, I might have to face this challenge again in week six, after that, I have to prepare for my final exam. Next, on 13th February I had been just studying the textbook about my topics I am working on. On 14th February I had submitted my programming assignment which was about Lab 5: â€œTape for a Turing Machine (Doubly-linked List). I had attached my code file with the demo test file and also give a screenshot of my output in my console. On15th February I had to post my discussion assignments which were about using ADTs (abstract data types) have advantages for program modularity. I had detailed the whole question by adding references. 

In my second point of the view, this week I did not face any problems while working on my assignments because at first I had been studying the chapter and try to understand the problem then I had been started working on my assignments. As I am a self-learner solving any problem by myself is a quite helpful strategy for me which already helping me build my critical thinking skills.
