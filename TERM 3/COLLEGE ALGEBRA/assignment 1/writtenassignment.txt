For this written assignment, answer the following questions showing all of your work.

1. Find the domain of the function using interval notation.

 f(x)= \frac{ \sqrt{x-6} }{ \sqrt{x-4} 


2. Sketch a graph of a piecewise function. Write the domain in interval notation.

[Suggestion: for example, go to www.desmos.com/calculator and write 

 y=x^2  for {-1 \leq x \leq 1}

and

y = 3x - 2 {1 \leq x \leq 3}

Then choose your own functions and have fun.]

3. 

The cost in dollars of making x items is given by the function C(x) = 10x + 500. 

a. The fixed cost is determined when zero items are produced. Find the fixed cost for this item.

b. What is the cost of making 25 items?

c. Suppose the maximum cost allowed is $1500. What are the domain and range of the cost function, C(x)?



ANSWER:

 In the beginning, the domain for this function will be going to be interval notation. 

Answer 1: Here the domain will be the graph that includes the input value which will present the x-axis. This domain would need to be interval notation which is  [0, 6) u (6, ∞). 

X - 6 ≥ 0
x  ≥ 6
As a result, [6,∞)
On the other hand,  
X - 4 ≥ 0
x  ≥ 4

This would be the divisor could not be 0. As well as the 0 of the evolution will be 4. Finally, the domain was not the domain that consists of 4. Thus, x > 4 and [4,∞). In a words, the domain with the functions will be X  ≥ 6 which is going to use as interval notation. 

Answer 1




ANSWER 2: 
The graph presented the piece of function which has f ( x ) = { x2 ,  -1 < x < 1 or, 3x - 2 , 1 < x < 3 } that would be represented as the domain of the graphs which includes each input the values with x-axis. The function will be undefined with the -1, 1 as well as 3. Finally, the domain will be going to be the interval notation with (-1, 1) u (1, 3). The graph will be shown below,



ANSWER 3: 

(a) By finding the fixed costs these will be substitute x = 0 which was the equation C(x) = 10x + 500.

C(0) = 10(0) + 500 or, C(0) = 500.

As a result, the fixed costs will be 500 dollars. 

(b) By finding the cost of making 25 items substitute x = 25 in the equation will be,  

C(x) = 10x + 500, 

C(25) = 10(25) + 500, 

C(25) = 750

As a result, the cost of making the twenty five items would be 750 dollars.



(c) In my third point of view, the maximum cost would be 1500 dollars. Here, 10(x) + 500 ≤ 1500,

Firstly, the subtract of the two sides, 10(x) ≤ 1000

Secondly, if I divide the two sides by 10, x ≤ 100, So if we make nearly 100 items, the domain would be [0, 100] and the range would be [0, 1500].
