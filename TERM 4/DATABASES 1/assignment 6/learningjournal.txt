Your Learning Journal entry must be a reflective statement that considers the following questions:

Describe what you did (This does not mean that you copy and paste from what you have posted or the assignments you have prepared. You need to describe what you did and how you did it), what you learned, your weekly activities, in what ways are you able to apply the ideas and concepts gained, and finally, describe one important thing that you are thinking about in relation to the activity.

Create two different “Views” using below relations, then Alter one of the Views and Drop the other one.  After that discuss why Views are used by giving examples using relations from the tables below.
