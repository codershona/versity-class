For the unit 4 assignment, you must create a circuit using Logism that implements a memory register capable of storing a 4 bit binary number.   You should investigate the different circuits that can be used to store a bit of memory and then utilize the one that meets the following requirements. 

Your register circuit must be able to support the inputs detailed in the following diagram:

Each bit of the register circuit must support a data in, a data out, and a control.  The control functions such that the data value will only be changed when the control bit is toggled on.

The value in the register must be persistent and can only be changed when the control bit has been toggled. 

You should develop and test the 4 bit register using logism. 

When you have successfully developed a functioning 4 bit register, you should duplicate the circuit and add it to the two inputs of the ALU circuit that you developed in the previous unit.

Complete and test all of your circuits using Logism and submit the following materials.

Using the export image feature in Logism (Use File-Export Image from menu), export your basic 4 bit register circuit in jpeg format include it as part of your post.  Moodle has the ability to insert a jpeg image.
Using the export image feature in Logism (Use File-Export Image from menu), export your registers added to your ALU from last week in jpeg format include it as part of your post.  Moodle has the ability to insert a jpeg image.
Save both of the logism models (4 bit register and the registers added to the ALU circuit) as circ fiels and and attach the file to your assignment posting.
