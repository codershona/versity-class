In Unit 2, we discussed API:

 

Write a program that calls fork(). Before calling fork(), have the main process access a variable (e.g., x) and set its value to some-thing (e.g., 100). What value is the variable in the child process? What happens to the variable when both the child and parent change the value of x?

 

Write out the code to your program.
Run the program and show your result.
What value is the variable in the child process?
What happens to the variable when both the child and parent change the value of x?
 

Your response must be a complete APA lab report (title page, conclusion and references page) and your own work. The conclusion is your thoughts about the assignment.
