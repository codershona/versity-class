Hello Everyone,

If you could select only three test case design methods to apply during unit testing, what would they be and why? 

Try to support your answer with example/ scenarios.


ANSWER:

  In the beginning, I am going to test a program where I would like to use some testing options. Moreover, if the three-test case methods are limited and I would like to select the value of the boundary analysis. Otherwise, it is also possible to choose the equal class partitioning as well as state transition. But we need to take a decision for this tricks in the table while it was stating the inapplicable. I need to also select the combination of the process and the reason is to cover the most group on the point of each group. The highest errors can be caused near by the boundaries to begin with the value analysis which can be found in the vast greater part of the errors. It can be also caught in the other's errors that can also match the class to partition the maximum efficient way to make a test in the non-boundary of the part of the program. Moreover, the state transition can be used approach to make possible in the map scenarios. This form of the map or table can be made none of the possibility scenarios which can be left untested. 

  For Instance, while we can test the calculator which is first created on each state transition map and can verify total setup choices as well as it can be resulted in the button combination for the user to make it. Next, it is possible to use the value in the boundary to the analysis which can be composed while there are no errors to occurs if there is any output to go high or low values of the hardware supports. Moreover, I will also test the rest of the program and use the copy class to partition by building sample groups for the expressions to serve as the vast sea of the possibility to make combine the calculator to make the encounter.
