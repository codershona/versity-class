The Learning Journal is a tool for self-reflection on the learning process. In addition to completing directed tasks, you should use the Learning Journal to document your activities, record problems you may have encountered and to draft answers for Discussion Forums and Assignments. The Learning Journal should be updated regularly (on a weekly basis), as the learning journals will be assessed by your instructor as part of your Final Grade.

Your learning journal entry must be a reflective statement that considers the following questions:

Describe what you did, what you learned, your weekly activities, in what ways are you able to apply the ideas and concepts gained ,  and finally, describe one important thing that you are thinking about in relation to the activity

 
ANSWER:

  In the beginning, I am going to talk about my last week of the course. Yes, finally it was the last week for me and the final exam is knocking at the door. I had logged into moodle at first and review my tasks for the last unit. Then I had to review my last week peers work and I went through the learning guide. This is, there was no assignment or task to complete so I just had to complete a self-quiz and learning journal. For the final exam there was also a review quiz for practice. I attempted the self-quiz at first after reviewing my last week written assignment and graded my three of peer work. I am taking preparation for my final exam. My entry for the last week unit task where there were no discussions or programming assessment to do. As a result, I am thankful for our instructor comments and advise which I found in this course and I am very happy where I had been learned a lot from this course. This course assists me in those last weeks. Thank you very much to our instructor.
