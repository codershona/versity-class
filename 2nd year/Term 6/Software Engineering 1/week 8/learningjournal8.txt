The Learning Journal is a tool for self-reflection on the learning process. In addition to completing directed tasks, you should use the Learning Journal to document your activities, record problems you may have encountered and to draft answers for Discussion Forums and Assignments. The Learning Journal should be updated regularly (on a weekly basis), as the learning journals will be assessed by your instructor as part of your Final Grade.

Your learning journal entry must be a reflective statement that considers the following questions:

Describe what you did, what you learned, your weekly activities, in what ways are you able to apply the ideas and concepts gained ,  and finally, describe one important thing that you are thinking about in relation to the activity


ANSWER:


This is the last unit of this course prior to final exam I logged into my Moodle to review my activities for this unit, after peer review i went through the learning guide, there are no assignments for this unit, learning journal and the self-quiz are the only given task for this unit, the final exam review is also active and I attempted and completed it and now I am ready for the final exam.My entry for this unit will be brief as there are no assignments and no discussions. I basically just reviewed my assignments from unit one down to unit 7 so as to help me prepare for the final exam.I am indeed grateful for your comments and advise, for this course I am really happy with what I have leant so far.This course has helped me a lot in these past weeks.Thank you, Instructor, I wish you well.
