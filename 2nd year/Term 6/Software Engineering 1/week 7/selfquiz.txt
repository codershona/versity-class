In the RSA system, the receiver does as follows:

Randomly select two large prime numbers p and q, which always must be kept secret.
Select an integer number E, known as the public exponent, such that (p 1) and E have no common divisors, and (q 1) and E have no common divisors.
Determine the private exponent, D, such that (ED 1) is exactly divisible by both (p 1) and (q 1). In other words, given E, we choose D such that the integer remainder when ED is divided by (p 1)(q 1) is 1.
Determine the product n = pq, known as public modulus.
Release publicly the public key, which is the pair of numbers n and E, K = (n, E). Keep secret the private key, K = (n, D).
The above events are mentioned in the correct order as they are performed while writing the algorithm.


A: False


Kerckhoffs’ Principle states that a cryptosystem should remain secure even if everything about it
other than the key is public knowledge. The security of a system’s design is in no way dependent
upon the secrecy of the design, in and of itself.


A: True


If you are able to anticipate that the components are likely to be reused in future projects then it is not advisable to use the Pub-Sub design pattern.


A: False



The term ____________is often used to describe modifying the design and/or implementation of a software module without changing its external behavior, and is sometimes informally referred to as “cleaning it up.”


A: c.
Refactoring


Indirect communication is usually used when an object cannot or does not want to know the identity of the object whose method it calls.

A: True
