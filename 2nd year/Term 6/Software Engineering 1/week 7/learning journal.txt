Learning Journal Unit 7
The Learning Journal is a tool for self-reflection on the learning process. In addition to completing directed tasks, you should use the Learning Journal to document your activities, record problems you may have encountered and to draft answers for Discussion Forums and Assignments. The Learning Journal should be updated regularly (on a weekly basis), as the learning journals will be assessed by your instructor as part of your Final Grade.

Your learning journal entry must be a reflective statement that considers the following questions:

Describe what you did, what you learned, your weekly activities, in what ways are you able to apply the ideas and concepts gained ,  and finally, describe one important thing that you are thinking about in relation to the activity


ANSWER:

Hi Instructor, it’s almost the business end of this course, hope you had a good day. Below is my entry for this week. 

Peer Assessment and Task Overview

As usual, I logged in to Moodle to check my activities for the week, and I peer assed unit6 programming assignment before I went through the course overview, course introduction, reading assignment, discussion assignment, learning journal, graded-quiz and self-quiz, I downloaded the materials provided for the week. 

Reading Assignment 


I started with my reading assignment where we were to read and understand 1 Indirect Communication: Publisher-Subscriber found in chapter 5.1 of our textbook and Program Security found chapter 5.5.4 of our textbook and at the same time sourced for additional materials. 

Discussion Assignment

I begin to work on my discussion assignment, where we were to answer questions from the textbook. I answered the question to the best of my knowledge, the material available and my other sources from the internet which I cited in my submission. 

Self-Quiz

I attempted the self-quiz unit 7 as a way to prepare myself for graded quiz for this unit, there was no programming assignment for this unit 

Graded Quiz

 I attempted and completed the graded quiz for unit 7, I did miss a question although I can’t wait to review the graded-quiz next week
 
 
Challenges
 
I did not face any challenges this week because as everything was to my expectation, but I was a little nervous about the graded quiz but I prepared and went for it.

Gains

This week I gained a lot from the discussion forum, from peer assessment and when sourcing for materials for programming assignment.This concludes my entry for Learning Journal Unit 7.

Thanks.
