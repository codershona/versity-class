Organizations are often fronted by a point-of-contact person. A common pattern is to have a specialized worker to take orders from the clients and orchestrate the workings of the workers inside the system. This type of object is known as Controller.

If you are able to anticipate that the components are likely to be reused in future projects then it is not advisable to use the Pub-Sub design pattern.


A: False


In the RSA system, the receiver does as follows:

Randomly select two large prime numbers p and q, which always must be kept secret.
Select an integer number E, known as the public exponent, such that (p - 1) and E have no common divisors, and (q - 1) and E have no common divisors.
Determine the private exponent, D, such that (ExD - 1) is exactly divisible by both (p - 1) and (q - 1). In other words, given E, we choose D such that the integer remainder when ExD is divided by (p - 1)x(q - 1) is 1.
Determine the product n = pxq, known as public modulus.
Release publicly the public key, which is the pair of numbers n and E, K + = (n, E). Keep secret the private key, K - = (n, D).
The above events are mentioned in the correct order as they are performed while writing the algorithm.

A: False
