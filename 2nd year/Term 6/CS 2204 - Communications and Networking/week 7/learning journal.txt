What TCP message will be generated for an incoming SYN request for which there is no matching LISTENING port? What error will be given to the application that requested the connection?

ANSWER:

 In the beginning, I am going to talk about the client application that can be sent by the first packet with "SYN" flag. But usually, It can happen when the server needs to listen on an individual port as well as to make responds in the SYN-ACK packet. But in order to acknowledge the "SYN" packet can be requested for the client apps. Moreover, the client apps need to respond including ACK packet and also notice that it can finish the establish connection.  

 In the second point of the view, the server also can bale to receive the "SYN" packet from the client apps. Next it can also listen to the individual posts and the connection can be rejected by the "RST" flag. It would show the output of any error messages, to see the refused connection. The connection rejection means errors can occur while the server can not able to listen on the right port. While the server can be in offline and try to check in the wrong port. The errors also would needs to be corrected to make sure where the server can able to listen to the right port and the server needs to be in online.
