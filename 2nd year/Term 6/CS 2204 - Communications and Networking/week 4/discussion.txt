IPv4’s ARP and IPv6’s Neighbor Solicitation both map an address from one space to another. In this respect they are similar. However, there are several differences. In what major ways do they differ?

ANSWER:


The differences between IPv4 as well as IPv6 had the main points which are given below,


==== The IPv4 ====

1. It could be addressed by the holding 32 bits.

2. The represented addresses need the binary numbers which can be utilized by the decimal number. 

3. The field needs a header for the checksum.

4. The option field is necessary for the present utilization.

5. It can also be used by the Static as well as Dynamic configuration.

6. There is also availability of the broadcast message services.

7. The multicast membership group needs to be managed by the internet group management protocol.

8. The ipv4 through mac can be used by the ARP protocol.

9. The tricks can be given by the sender fragmentation. 

==== The IPV6 ====

1. The IPv4 take in the length which needs 32 bits on the other hand, 128 bits can able to contribute the address of the IPv6.

2. The IPv6 is applicable of the multicast operation services.

3. The method has no checksum for the IPv6.

4. The automatic configuration address only in ipv6 on the other hand, can have both configuration which is acceptable into ipv4. 

5. The binary numbers can be also utilize with hexadecimal number to represent the IPv6 address.
