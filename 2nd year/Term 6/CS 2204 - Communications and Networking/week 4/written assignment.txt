Answer the following questions (Dordal P., 2014) in your own words:

1.  For each IPv4 network prefix given (with length), identify which of the subsequent IPv4 addresses are part of the same subnet.

(a). 10.0.130.0/23: 10.0.130.23, 10.0.129.1, 10.0.131.12, 10.0.132.7

(b). 10.0.132.0/22: 10.0.130.23, 10.0.135.1, 10.0.134.12, 10.0.136.7

(c). 10.0.64.0/18: 10.0.65.13, 10.0.32.4, 10.0.127.3, 10.0.128.4

(d). 10.0.168.0/21: 10.0.166.1, 10.0.170.3, 10.0.174.5, 10.0.177.7

(e). 10.0.0.64/26: 10.0.0.125, 10.0.0.66, 10.0.0.130, 10.0.0.62

 

2.  Convert the following subnet masks to /k notation, and vice-versa:

(a). 255.255.240.0

(b). 255.255.248.0

(c). 255.255.255.192

(d). /20

(e). /22

(f). /27

 

3.  Suppose an Ethernet packet represents a TCP acknowledgment; that is, the packet contains an IPv4 header with no options and a 20-byte TCP header but nothing else. Is the IPv4 packet here smaller than the Ethernet minimum packet size, and, if so, by how much? What if the packet is IPv6 with no extension headers?

 

4. In newer implementations, repeat ARP queries about a timed out entry are first sent unicast, in order to reduce broadcast traffic. What would have to happen to create a situation where the repeated unicast query for a given IP address fails, but a follow-up broadcast query for that same IP address succeeds?

Paper Guidelines

2-3 pages in length, in your own words, properly cite any outside resources.  Use 1" margins and Times Roman Font, 12-point, or something comparable.   The paper should be well organized with proper grammar and spelling. 

Be sure to properly cite any sources you use using APA format.  You can get some help on APA formatting here: Purdue Online Writing Lab. (n.d.). APA style introduction. Purdue University. https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html

EXERCISES 

ANSWER 1: 

 Here I am going to discuss about the for each IPv4 network prefix given (with length), identify which of the subsequent IPv4 addresses are part of the same subnet, which are given below,

(a). 10.0.130.0/23: 10.0.130.23, 10.0.129.1, 10.0.131.12, 10.0.132.7 

10.0.130.0/23: 00001010.00000000.10000010.00000000/23

The range would be: 10.0.130.0 – 10.0.131.855

As a result, 10.0.130.23 and 10.0.131.12 these two parts were the similar with the subnet and the others does not include with it. 



(b). 10.0.132.0/22: 10.0.130.23, 10.0.135.1, 10.0.134.12, 10.0.136.7

10.0.132.0 = 00001010.00000000.10000100.00000000 

The range would be: 10.0.132.0 – 10.0.135.255

As a result, 10.0135.1 and 10.0.134.12 were has the similar subnet but other does not had. 

(c). 10.0.64.0/18: 10.0.65.13, 10.0.32.4, 10.0.127.3, 10.0.128.4

10.0.64.0 = 00001010.00000000.01000000.00000000

The range would be: 10.0.64.0 – 10.0.127.255

As a result, 10.0.65.13 and 10.0.127.3 were has the similar subnet but other does not had. 

(d). 10.0.168.0/21: 10.0.166.1, 10.0.170.3, 10.0.174.5, 10.0.177.7

10.0.168.0 = 00001010.00000000.10101000.00000000


The range would be: 10.0.168.0 – 10.0.175.255

As a result,, 10.0.170.3 and 10.0.174.5 were has the similar subnet but other does not had. 

(e). 10.0.0.64/26: 10.0.0.125, 10.0.0.66, 10.0.0.130, 10.0.0.62 

10.0.0.64 = 00001010.00000000.00000000.01000000

The range would be: 10.0.0.64 – 10.0.0.127

As a result, 10.0.0.125 and 10.0.0.66 were has the similar subnet but other does not had.


ANSWER 2:

(a). 255.255.240.0 = /20

(b). 255.255.248.0 = /21

(c). 255.255.255.192 = /26

(d). /20 = 255.255.240.0

(e). /22 = 255.255.252.0

(f). /27 = 255.255.255.224




ANSWER 3:
 
 In my opinion, it is Yes, the IPv4 packet has the lower than the ethernet which has minimum size of the packet. The 20-bytes has no options in the header of the IPv4 that enclose the packet. Moreover, the 20-byte TCp has header and made up the entire 40-byte packet. The 64 bytes also has the ethernet which has least possible packet size. 

  As a result, the 24 bytes is lower packet on the IPv4. It could be 64 bytes - 40 bytes. The 40 bytes has headers with no other extension packet IPv6. The minimal packet size was still lower than the ethernet minimal packet size.  

ANSWER 4:

  We can use the ARP to broadcast to figure out the MAC address which has comaprison with any IP address. This can be prepare with the completing first order in the packets to ordered with the unicast. The latest implementation needs the unicasts to transmitted with the first and next the query to provide the IP address which could be falied. Moreover, while the broadcast could be dispatched first and it could successfully had the query.
