Networks are designed in a number of ways, based on the geographical area, the technology used, user group specific, application-based, etc. But we can roughly categorize the communication networks in 2 broad categories, based on transmission: Connection-Oriented and Connectionless.

Please discuss the two categories. Your comments should include the following:

Point by point comparison of their advantages and disadvantages (at least 3 advantages and 3 disadvantages)
Point by point comparison of the design issues for both
Your preference among the two and a suggestion to resolve any one of its design-related problem.
Paper Guidelines

2-3 pages in length, in your own words, properly cite any outside resources.  Use 1" margins and Times Roman Font, 12-point, or something comparable.   The paper should be well organized with proper grammar and spelling. 

Be sure to properly cite any sources you use using APA format.  You can get some help on APA formatting here: Purdue Online Writing Lab. (n.d.). APA style introduction. Purdue University. https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html
