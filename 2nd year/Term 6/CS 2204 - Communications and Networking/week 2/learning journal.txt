CRC or Cyclic Redundancy Check is an error control method used in Ethernet where a checksum is computed and appended to the data frame being sent across the channel.

Please explain briefly, in your own words.

why is the CRC put in the trailer rather than in the header of the frame?


ANSWER:

  In the beginning, I am going to talk about the technique of the CRC. We can check the errors in the data to make a change while causing in the channel of the communication. Moreover, the binary number requires to be generated by tthesender so that it can be appended in the end. Otherwise the receiver would need to receive the binary numbers to read the CRC. Any other way the output would be zero by checking it. While it would be zero without having any errors. By sending the data it would be better to establish the CRC trailer to calculate in the same time. Without regard to, the CRC can be calculated by putting the header in the entire frame of the hardware which is also important to read. Next we can send into the CRC. As a result, it is also necessary to handle two or more a bytes and rest of them are for the transmitting.
