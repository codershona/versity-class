The Split Horizon fix to the slow-convergence problem prevents all linear routing loops.

A: True

In link-state routing, each node keeps a maximum amount of network information about of all nodes and all links.


A: True


In distance-vector routing, each node has a complete view of the network topology.


A:  False

Subnetting allows aggregation of IP address blocks in a way that is visible to the Internet backbone.

A: False


The CIDR longest-match rule for choosing the routing table entry to be used means

A: c.
using the most specific matching prefix

In link-state routing implementations, link-state records must be periodically renewed

A: True

BGP speakers exchange with neighbors only the routes they (and thus their AS) use themselves.

A: True

The link-state flooding algorithm avoids the usual problems of broadcast in the presence of loops by:

A: a.
