Q1. A router has the following CIDR entries in the routing table:

 

Address/Mask

Next Hop

135.46.56.0/22

Interface 0

135.46.60.0/22

Interface 1

192.53.40.0/23

Router 1

Default 

Router 2


For each of the following IP addresses, what does the router do if a packet with that address arrives?

135.46.63.10
135.46.57.14
135.46.52.2
192.53.40.7
192.53.56.7

Q2. A Large number of consecutive IP address are available starting at 198.16.0.0. Suppose four organizations, A, B, C, D request 4000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 addresses, respectively. For each of these organizations, give:

the first IP address assigned
the last IP address assigned 
the mask in the w.x.y.z/s notation
 

Q3. A router R has the following distance-vector table:

 

Destination

Cost

Next hop

 A

 2

 R1

 B

 3

 R2

 C

 4

 R1

 D

 5

 R3

 

R now receives the following report from R1 (the cost of the R–R1 link is 1):

<dest: A, cost: 1>, <dest: B, cost: 1>, <dest: C, cost: 4>, <dest: D, cost: 4>.

 

Give R’s updated table after it processes R1’s report. For each entry, give a brief explanation.

Answer all questions, in your own words, properly cite any outside resources.  Use 1" margins and Times Roman Font, 12-point, or something comparable.   The paper should be well organized with proper grammar and spelling. 

Be sure to properly cite any sources you use using APA format.  You can get some help on APA formatting here: Purdue Online Writing Lab. (n.d.). APA style introduction. Purdue University. https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html
