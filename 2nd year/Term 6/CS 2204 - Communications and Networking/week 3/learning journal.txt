A guide for writing a “reflective journal:”

Who will read the journal?

The contents of your journal will be only visible to the instructor. Unlike discussion forums or blogs, the journal is an area for reflection without a wide audience.

Why do it?

Maintaining a journal serves several purposes:

A means of communication, conversation (e.g., between material and yourself, yourself and instructors).
Provides regular feedback between you and the instructors and helps to match expectations.
Platform for synthesis of knowledge and ideas
Help develop critical thinking
Helps to elicit topics of interest, challenging topics that need improvement, etc.
What to write?

Answer the following question:

Give any two reasons why networks might use Error Correcting Codes instead of Error Detection and Retransmission.

What not to do:

Do not copy and paste any material from the discussion forum, your own assignment, or any other source. The entries in the journal must be your own words.

When do I use the journal?

You are expected to use the journal for each week of the course.

How will it be graded?

Each weekly journal must be at least 150 words long. Please use proper grammar and keep your writing on the class topic. Deductions from a full credit on this assignment would be taken if you copy and paste content. As long as you write down your own reflection about the learning activities, deductions will not be taken. You will receive a single grade for each week and the grades will count toward your final grade in the course.
