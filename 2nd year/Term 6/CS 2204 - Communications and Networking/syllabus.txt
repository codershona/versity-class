CS 2204 COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING

Syllabus

Prerequisites: CS 1104 Computer Systems


Course Description:

Communications and Networking is a course where you will get to know and understand the basics of networking and electronic communication. Throughout the course, we will mainly be focusing on the two most prevalent reference models of network definition, OSI and TCP/IP. We will be studying these in detail and will explore every layer of these models. By the end of the course, you will be having a fair understanding of data is transferred from one computer to another, in a classroom or in a college campus or across the cities or over the internet.

Course Requirements:


Assignments
There is an Assignment to be completed for each of the study units in this course except for Unit 8. You will be required to upload your assignments by the indicated deadline. Failure to submit assignments may result in failure of the course.


Discussion Forum
There are Discussion Forum questions to be completed for each study unit in this course. In each unit, you will be required to post your response to the question in the forum. In addition, you must provide constructive commentary on at least three of your peers’ postings and rate their work between one and five according to the guidelines provided.


Discussion Forums are only active for the relevant learning week and it is not possible to contribute to a discussion forum once the learning week has come to an end. Failure to participate in the Discussion Forums may result in failure of the course

Course Forum
The Course Forum is the place to raise issues and questions relating to the course. It is monitored by the instructor. It is a good place to meet fellow students taking the same course. While it is not required to participate in this forum, it is highly recommended.

Learning Journal
The Learning Journal is a tool for self-reflection on the learning process. In addition to completing directed tasks, you should use the Learning Journal to document your activities, record problems you may have encountered and to draft answers for Discussion Forums and Assignments. The Learning Journal should be updated regularly (on a weekly basis), as the learning journals will be assessed by your instructor as part of your Final Grade.

Graded Quizzes

There will be two graded quizzes in this course, one in Unit 3 and the other in Unit 6. As opposed to the self-quizzes, which can be found in each unit and are non-graded, the graded quizzes do count towards your final grade.

Final Examination
The Final Exam will take place during the Thursday and Sunday of Week/Unit 9, following the completion of eight units of work. The format of the Final Exam is similar to that of the quizzes and may contain a combination of different question types. You will have one attempt to take the exam, and it will be graded electronically. Specific instructions on how to prepare for and take the Final Exam will be provided during Week 8 (located inside the Unit 9 Learning Guide). Final Exams must be taken without the use of course learning materials (both those inside and outside the course). If particular materials are allowed for use during the exam, these will be noted in the exam’s instructions.

Grade Appeal
Final Grades may be appealed when you believe that the grade you have been assigned for a course is unjust or unfair. For more information on the Grade Appeal procedure, please refer to the Student Handbook.

Participation
Non-participation is characterized by a lack of assignment submission and/or inadequate contribution in discussion forum postings.

Assignments must be submitted on or before the deadline. A course timeline is provided in the course schedule. The instructor will specify the deadline for each assignment.
Occasionally there may be a legitimate reason for submitting an assignment late. Late assignments will not be accepted, and there will be no make-up assignments. Students should review the Late Assignment Policy appearing in the Student Handbook.
Any student showing non-participation for 2 weeks (consecutive or non-consecutive) is likely to automatically fail the course.

All students are obligated to inform their instructor in advance of any known absences which may result in their non-participation.

Academic Honesty and Integrity

Unless otherwise stated, any materials cited in this course should be referenced using the style guidelines established by the American Psychological Association (APA).
