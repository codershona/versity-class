Learning Journal Unit 2

For your Learning Journal, you are to write a 1-2 paragraph (no more than 250 words) description on how reading can impact you or your society.

A:

I am thankful a great deal that I grew up during an era where reading was part and parcel of schools and society. Nothing would be hidden in a book, script, or newspaper that I would notfind. I can call myself an avid reader. Reading is one of the main reasons I managed to find the University of the People on the Internet. One of the quotes about reading that I totally agree with is," The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn the more places you will go."( Dr. Seuss,n.d.).

As an avid reader, I have been impacted by reading a great deal. Growing up with very limited resources, my only source of learning and exposure to information has been through reading books and any material that I come across in books, magazines, or any printed media.The most impact that I get through reading is the knowledge of places I have never set my foot. Also the knowledge of operating machines and gadgets that might not be very familiar. Reading connects me with friends from far and wide., as well as helps me to know about the diversity in cultures around the world.

I will close with one of my favorite author's quotes," If you are going to get anywhere in life, you have to read a lot of books." ( Dahl,n.d.). You can never be lonely with a book in your hand.
