Learning Journal Unit 2

For your Learning Journal, you are to write a 1-2 paragraph (no more than 250 words) description on how reading can impact you or your society.

A:

I am thankful a great deal that I grew up during an era where reading was part and parcel of schools and society. Nothing would be hidden in a book, script, or newspaper that I would not find. I can call myself an avid reader and by reading is one of the main reasons I managed to find the University of the People on the Internet. One of the quotes about reading that I totally agree with is," The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn the more places you will go."( Dr. Seuss,n.d.). As an avid reader, I have been impacted by reading a great deal. The most impact that I get through reading is the knowledge of places I have never set my foot but also the knowledge of operating machines and gadgets that might not be very familiar. Reading connects me with friends from far and wide., as well as helps me to know about the diversity in cultures around the world.

I will close with one of my favorite author's quotes," If you are going to get anywhere in life, you have to read a lot of books." ( Dahl,n.d.). You can never be lonely with a book in your hand.



------> In the beginning, school and society valued reading heavily when I was growing up, and I appreciate that very much. Besides this, it is unlikely that anything would be hidden in a book, script, or newspaper that I would not find. But also, a passion for reading led me to the University of the People on the Internet. There is a quote about reading that I totally agree with, "You will learn more by reading; you will also have more places to go by learning more by reading." (Dr. Seuss, n.d.). Over and above, having been a reader all my life, I have been affected greatly by reading. In addition, with very limited resources, my only source for learning and exposure to information has been through reading books and any other printed materials I can acquire through books, magazines, and any other written means. By the same token, reading most impacts me by learning about new places I've never been to, along with new ways to operate machines and gadgets with which I'm not very familiar. What is more, by reading, I make friends from around the globe, as well as gain knowledge about the differences in cultures around the world. Last but not least, the last quote I'm going to share with you is one of my favourite quotes by author Roald Dahl: "To succeed in life, you must read a great deal." (Hazel, n.d.) and also, because a book never leaves you lonely.
