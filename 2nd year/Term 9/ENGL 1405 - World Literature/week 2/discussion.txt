When you notice or pay attention them, a comedy is any job of artwork that makes you laugh. Comedy is a sort of artwork that amuses people, in step with Hoy (n.d.).

Life is complete of troubles; it's miles excellent to neglect about approximately those troubles as soon as in a at the same time as. I do not forget any job of artwork that may make me neglect about any troubles on the identical time that make me chuckle at the same time as it is able to be get up conversations (stand-up comedy) with humour, or brought with humour, films or maybe writings. One comic that I continually idea turned into humorous is Robin Williams. It's unlucky that he's now no longer alive anymore, however his films will stay on forever. The movie “Mrs Doubtfire” that he starred in, is one of the satisfactory comedy films in my opinion.
