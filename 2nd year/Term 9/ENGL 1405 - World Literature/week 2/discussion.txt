For your Discussion Assignment, you will write a 1-2 paragraph answer to: “What to YOU is Comedy?”  What do you find funny? Can you give examples of stories, authors or other arts that you find humor? Also, WHY do you find those things funny?

In addition, you must extend the discussion by responding to at least three (3) of your peers’ postings in the Discussion Forum and by rating their posts. Instructions for proper posting and rating are provided inside the Discussion Forum for each week.


A:

When you see or hear them, a comedy is any work of art that makes you laugh. Comedy is a type of art that amuses people, according to Hoy (n.d.). It is totally different from Tragedy written (made) to make you weep and somewhat different from Tragicomedy, which has a combination of both to make you cry and laugh.

Life is full of issues; it is nice to forget about these problems once in a while. I consider any work of art that can make me forget any issues at the same time that make me laugh while it may be stand up conversations (stand-up comedy) with humor, or delivered with humor, movies or even writings.One comedian that I always thought was funny is Robin Williams. It’s unfortunately that he’s not aliveanymore, but his movies will live on forever. The movie “Mrs. Doubtfire” that he starred in, is one of the best comedy movies in my opinion.
