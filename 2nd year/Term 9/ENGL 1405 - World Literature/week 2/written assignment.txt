You have read a piece of Comedy for this unit. For this experiment in analysis, you are to write a 3-4 paragraph diary entry for one of the characters in the story you’ve read this week.  It should be on any day that is NOT listed in the story. For example, if the main character stole a horse in the story, you can write about what YOU think the character does on the other days of his life.

A great way to start would be, “Dear Diary” and then just tell what you think that person would write in his or her diary. You should use a lot of thought for this, but also have fun with it.

ANSWER:


Hello, dear diary. Today is again the same day as yesterday. After so many years beinggone I still remain the same Ivan Yakovlevitch. When I woke up in the morning I hadsome tea because we ran out of coffee. It would be great to have some food forbreakfast too, but we started arguing with my wife again so I had to leave the house quickly. That sort of fights bores me but I perceive it as something natural.

After leaving the house I went to work at my barber shop. I should have been in ahurry because I was pretty late, however, I was walking calmly while breathing thecoldish Saint Petersburg’s air. For a moment I stopped beside Neva’s shore and wasjust looking at a grey horizont. Depressing. This city is depressing.

At work I shaved lots of customers today. Most of them are pretty arrogant andbelieve that they are better than me in various fields. Do I care about it? Not really. I am not an ambitious person, I just live my life. I would not tell you that I am too happy with my achievements but I also do not regret my actions. When the job wasdone I decided to go to the nearest local bar to have some drinks and conversations. I especially enjoy talking with strangers: you never know what they will answer, howthey will act. You also may never see them again.

There was so much fun in a bar- I got drunk and was afraid to come home...Ahah, andI was totally right that I was afraid- my wife started a scandal saying “You areuseless!!” and threw my things out of the window. It was tough to find all mybelongings being drunk and in complete darkness. I have used my “technique” to getaway from fights- just say nothing and be quiet, ignore the conflict. It worked asalways. Now I finally can go to sleep…
