ANSWER:

They came in the quiet of the night. Hundreds of ships converged on earth at once. We weren'tready and they didn't give us a chance. They first attacked the military bases of every country, then attacked any power sources as well as any communication towers.

But what they didn't count on or maybe didn't know was that humans are fighters. We launchedmissiles and bombs, and turned our weapons on their ships. We found ways to communicate with our fellow man across the globe even with the destruction of communication satellites.

We learned. Any time a ship was brought down, any and everything was examined. We had people working to learn their language - both written and spoken. There were people learning their technology and how it can help us. Doctors examined their dead to try to find their weaknesses.

They expected a quick extermination, we are still fighting back. Every time we learn something new, it is passed along to other countries. These aliens have brought us together, they have united humans to one cause. Humans have gone deep underground. What was once meant tobe fall out shelters have become bunkered homes to thousands of people. If someone needs togo topside, they have to go at night. 

It looked like we might turn this around. But the aliens weren't done. They released monsters. Horrible, hideous creatures that could mimic a human voice and cry for help. They lured many to their death.

Again we learned. Our communications are now followed by a changing series of clicks to confirm it to be from a human.

Their monsters hunted - day and night they roamed. They hungrily fed on any living thing. Man,and/or animal, nothing escaped. Even the oceanic animals fell prey to these monsters. If hunters found a weakness in a bunker, they swarmed it and tore it apart. It was like sardines in a can. The people inside were sitting ducks. They would fight valiantly but in the end, no survivors.

My name is Katarina "Killy" Nakane and I fled with my family to Eagle Mountain, a military outpost dug deep inside a mountain. My parents are scientists working on alien technology. I help where I can but I am neither scientist nor soldier. Though I am becoming both. I spend a majority of my time in the hydro gardens where we raise our food or in the simulators where I have begun to teach myself how to fly their crafts, and use their weapons. My father doesn't like that I have picked up soldier qualities. He especially worries because their language is easyfor me to understand and I've begun to be able to use their computers.  

I'm... I'm in trouble, we're in trouble! I'm pretty sure I led the aliens to Eagle Mountain. A large swarm of hunters has been trying to break through our defenses. People are scrambling to go deeper into the mountain or find a way to escape. No one knows how they found us but I"m pretty sure my connecting to their computer led them straight to me.


The general in charge has learned of my abilities. He wants me to lead them away. My parentsare horrified with this idea. I'm being used like a lamb to slaughter. Doesn't help that the hunters have started to chant my name and have increased their attempts to get inside. Why are they chanting my name? How do they know it? What do they want with me?

They've broken through! I can hear the screams! The gunfire! My parents have been taken to the lowest levels while the general locked me in my parents' lab. Please help me! They're coming!
