ANSWER:

This story caught my attention: "Jeremy and the Magic Lobster by Matthew Licht" (http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/JereMagi942.shtml)

Jeremy, the main character of this story, meets the other main character, the 'magic' lobster, in this story that seems more aimed at kids. According to my understanding, the lobster was acting as if he were a magician in order to trick Jeremy so that he (the lobster) might live an easier and more successful life out of the ocean.

Jeremy was my favourite character, and I also liked that he seemed like a good kid who knew, after a bit, that he was being tricked, and handled it almost the way I would have handled it if I were his age. Everyone dislikes a liar, after all, no matter what their age is.
