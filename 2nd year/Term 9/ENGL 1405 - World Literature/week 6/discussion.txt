ANSWER:


I read this story:"Jeremy and the Magic Lobster by Matthew Licht (http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/JereMagi942.shtml)"

This story seems to be aimed more towards kids, and it was about the main character, Jeremy, and his encounter with the other main character, the "magic" lobster. I quote the word 'magic' because the lobster seemed to pass himself off as such in order to trick Jeremy so that he (the lobster) could live a better life outside of the ocean.

The character that I liked best was Jeremy himself. He seemed like a good kid who knew, after a bit, that he was being duped and handled it almost the same way that I would have handled it if I was his age. No one likes a liar, after all, no matter how old you are.
