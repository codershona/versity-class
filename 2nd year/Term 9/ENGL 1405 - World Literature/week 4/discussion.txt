PLEASE READ:

Hi, Everyone.

If you decide to read "The Eyes Have It," please be aware that there is a lot of wordplay and many idiomatic expressions. It is more comedy than sci fi. For a start, "The eyes have it" is a play on words. The expression is "The ayes have it," meaning that more people said yes than no. Aye = yes. Here is a list of some examples:

“…his eyes slowly roved about the room” = He looked slowly around the room
“…his eyes moved from person to person” = Same – looking around the room at the other people
“The eyes had clearly come apart from the rest of him and were on their own” = The narrator mistakenly thinks that the character’s eyes became detached from their body
“…presently his eyes fastened on Julia” = He looked right at Julia and stared at her
“…he put his arm around Julia. Presently she asked him if he would remove his arm. He immediately did so, with a smile” = He was embracing her and she asked him to stop
Man with arm around woman
“…outside the movie theater we split up. Part of us went inside, part over to the café for dinner” = Some of the group went to the café, the other part of the group didn’t
“…he has utterly no guts” = He is a coward
“Julia had given her heart to the young man” She fell in love with him
“I have absolutely no stomach for it” = He can’t handle it/isn’t emotionally strong enough for it



ANSWER:

I read: 2 B R 0 2 B by Kurt Vonnegut. The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world where overpopulation ruined the world. In this future population control has been enforced with controlled euthanisation centres, or assisted suicide centres as part of the control - encouragingthe people to keep the population in check, the world is at peace, there is more than enough to sustain its inhabitants and the problems of an overpopulated world are eradicated (Vonnegut. 1962.)

We're a minute to midnight

Professor Bartlett's beaker theory is perhaps best known because of the book (now movie), Inferno (Brown. 2016). Bartlett's beaker is the theory of Exponential growth in a finite environment, much like humans on this blue-green spec in the cosmos. The film explains the theory incredibly well, I've added the CLIP for exactly that reason BECAUSE does it so well (Brown, Howard. 2016).

The truth is that overpopulation is a threat that we can't overlook, and it seems just as we humans have disregarded the problems of the past. Mans no-consequence outlook on the planets finite resources will yet again be the root of coming problems. The evidence is overwhelmingly against us, and it seems that we have little regard for the impending problems we face.


As the clip says - we're a minute to midnight. We can't see the problem 1 minute before the beaker spills - even at 11:59 the beaker is still half empty. The question is - what will the future hold when we are faced with the absolute certainty of starvation, famine, disease... We have relative abundance now - what will this future hold?

Is it so unreasonable to believe that we as a species should probably prepare for drastic measures to curb overpopulation? Do you really think that a future of planned control is not viable? Let's just say that we have little thinking to do.
