The ability to analyze a story can be further demonstrated by creating something new. For your Written Assignment, you will take the story you read for this week and write a one paragraph news story based upon the story.  Think of how a news reporter would explain those events to an audience. Focus on what you think the main facts of the story are and deliver it as a news article written by you.

Remember: You can quote dialog here, but you must create the news article using original work.




ANSWER:


My work is based on the story "A Sound of Thunder" by Ray Bradbury. Of course, I can constructthe title as: "A butterfly from the past determined the election results," using the active voice, but Ieliminated some articles (a, the), preposition (by), and auxiliary verb (was) from the passive voiceconstruction on purpose. Passive voice in the title is used knowingly as well. I pay your attention: please,do not consider it as error when you assess my work.


Breaking News: Election Determined Butterfly from The Past

There is a stir in the White House. Deutscher has become the president by the happy occasion,which had a place in the past. Thousands of people go out to streets, demanding election review. As ourcorrespondent was informed, a butterfly caused different election results. The information becameavailable thanks to unlicensed time travelers who had revealed flagrant violation committed by TimeSafari Inc. Details of the event are as follows: three hunters and two guides went on a safari for a dinosaurhunt. All things were as planned but at the last moment, one of the hunters (Mr. Eckels) turned yellow,and he was commanded to return to a time machine. While returning, the hunter stepped aside from ananti-gravity track and dared walking in the ancient jungle where he crushed a butterfly. The unlicensedtime travelers traced the possible future line of the butterfly. They insist that if not for the butterfly, wewould have Keith, who won the presidential election yesterday, not Deutscher. However, that hunter and apoor butterfly is one side of the story. In addition, a hunters' victim, a massive Tyrannosaurus Rex,destroyed a good part of the anti-gravity track while falling. A special police unit is departing to the pastto check unplanned deaths of other beings, besides the butterfly and the dinosaur.


This story raises different questions: Will Deutscher hold his post? Will time travel be forbidden?Will Eckels take a position in Deutscher's government? Follow us.Breaking news. Especially for ENGL 1405.
