ANSWER:


Since the beginning of Science fiction movies, so many technologies have emerged and have become real. When technology wasn't as far along then as it is, it was amazing to see how they predicted. Since we are so technologically advanced and so confident that anything is possible, it would have made sense if it were predicted during our current era. During the olden days, people used to come up with ideas and thoughts in remarkably creative ways.

A number of things can be discussed, such as the Hover Board in Back to the Future movie Part 2 and the self-driving car in the movie which was predicted 30 years in advance. As a result, many auto manufacturers, such as Lexus, BMW and Mercedes, produce self-driving cars. The costs are high right now, but eventually, they will be affordable and widespread. New technologies are all expensive when they are introduced, but they gradually become more affordable as time goes by. Probably the best of all was the military drones used in the terminator movie in 1984. Nevertheless, drones are now a reality and, as I said, technology becomes more affordable when it becomes more commonplace. With the ease with which drones can be used, they come at quite a reasonable price.

It is being used for a wide range of purposes, from medical research to protect a country, as well as for everyday tasks such as photography and video blogging. Furthermore, criminals have been able to use this technology in the past, as a drug cartel tried to use it to send drugs over the border, but fortunately, the drone could not withstand the weight and fell and was captured. For some of us born in the 1970s and 1980s, it was an absolute blessing to live without phones, computers, etc. owing to technological advances so that the younger generations can't appreciate what it was like then and now from their own perspective.
