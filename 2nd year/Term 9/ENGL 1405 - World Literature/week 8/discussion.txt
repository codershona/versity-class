For your Discussion Assignment, you will write about the graphic text you read. DON'T re-tell the story. You will describe what you thought of when you read it. Try to interpret the images into your own words.

In addition, you must extend the discussion by responding to at least three (3) of your peers’ postings in the Discussion Forum and by rating their posts. Instructions for proper posting and rating are provided inside the Discussion Forum for each week.

A: 


Before attempting this week’s discussion forum assignment, I want to use this opportunity toThanks my instructor Kristian Macaron and all my classmates that these past 8 weeks has beenone of the best time of my life in recent years because the knowledge gained in this coursehas superseded my expectation which has enabled me to build on the knowledge gain fromthe previous English class which will not have been possible without you. I wish us all thebest in our exams as we move on in our academic pursuits.

For   this   week’s   discussion   forum   assignment,   the   graphic   text   I   chose   to   read   is   titledDreamless   written   by   Bobby   Crosby.   In   the   beginning,   I   thought   the   story   was   aboutexorcism because it has some religious component but it turned out that I was not correct. Then I saw again the main female character pulled out a gun, this got me thinking the story isgoing to be some sort of spy story but tuned out again that I was incorrect.  And after I fullyread the story, I was able to determine that the setting of the story takes place during WWIIand the main characters of the story are an American girl and a Japanese boy.  They had avery unique   and  interesting connection and   eventually fall in  love with each other.   Theauthor did a really good job with the plot twists, and the illustrator did an amazing job(Crossby, 2008).
