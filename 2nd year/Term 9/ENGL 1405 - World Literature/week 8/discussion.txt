For your Discussion Assignment, you will write about the graphic text you read. DON'T re-tell the story. You will describe what you thought of when you read it. Try to interpret the images into your own words.

In addition, you must extend the discussion by responding to at least three (3) of your peersâ€™ postings in the Discussion Forum and by rating their posts. Instructions for proper posting and rating are provided inside the Discussion Forum for each week.

It would not have been possible for me to build on the knowledge I gained from the previous English class without your help. Thanks to this course and to my instructor, Katherine Burton, and all my classmates, these past eight weeks have been one of the best times in my life since I started this course. The knowledge I gained from this course has been unlike anything I have ever experienced, and I am grateful. In continuing our academic pursuits, I wish us all the best with our exams.

In my discussion forum posting this week, I selected the graphic text titled Dreamless was written by Bobby Crosby.  My first impression was that the story was about an exorcism since it has a religious theme, but it turned out that I was not right. Once again I noticed that the main female character was pulling out a gun, this got me wondering if the story was going to be a spy thriller, but I soon realised my thought was incorrect. After I spent a total amount of time reading the story, I determined that the setting took place during WWII and that the protagonists were an American girl and a Japanese boy. The two of them have a unique and interesting connection, and eventually, fall in love with each other.   Despite the plot twists and the illustrator's amazing skills, the author did a great job with the storyline(Crossby, 2008).
