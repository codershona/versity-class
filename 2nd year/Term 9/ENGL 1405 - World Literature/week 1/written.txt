Story Name: “Aunt ZeZe’s Tears”

Story Written By: Carmen Dolores

In my first week in this course, I read one story that was interestingly called "Aunt ZeZe's Tears", where the story written by Carmen Dolores, which was a bit difficult for me to comprehend. This story influenced me because I am an emotional type of person. Moreover, the way she dealt with many sacrifices was very heart-touching that had left me in a state of desperation. Moreover, if I talk about my day that could cause a change terribly, where the reason might be I sacrifice everything for others. Besides, it would be exceedingly difficult for me to handle these responsibilities at the same time as my current life is gloomy and unhappening. To wrap up, I would count down the minutes and just do what was necessary to get through the day, and my day would involve some occasional fits of rage because of my frustration.
