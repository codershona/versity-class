ANSWER:


“Aunt ZeZe’s Tears”

By: Carmen Dolores

To live in a world of the story, “Aunt ZeZe’s Tears” by Carmen Dolores would be very hard for me. I tend to be an emotional person and having to deal with making the sacrifices she did would leave me in a state of despair. My day would change drastically because there would be no time for myself or self-care having to sacrifice so much of myself for others. I would not be able to focus on the responsibilities that I currently have and life would be very sad and depressing. My day would be a series of counting down the time and just doing what it takes to just make it through and there might even be occasional outbursts because of being unhappy.
