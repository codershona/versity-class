ANSWER:

I  story that I read about was entitled One These Days by G. G .Marquez.  Things that stood out for me are that the narrator writes about two men who lack professionalism, because the dentist runs his business at his house instead of having a proper surgery. Also the dentist involves his son who is young inhis business which I thought that it is a bit inappropriate. The town mayor comes to the dentist and the person he finds outside is the dentist’s son, and when he asks him to tell his father that he came for consultation there is an exchange of words (Marquez, 1928-2014) and the child is used to pass the wordsbetween the two. Another thing that I noticed is that the world that these people live is quite strange, they are not scared to threaten each other the dentist’s son tells his father that the mayor will shoot himif he does not attend to him and in the dentist’s response in he says , “Tell him to come and shoot me”.(Maquez, 1928-2014, p. 9). I also find the mayor being a bit insane because he allows the dentist to remove his tooth without injecting an anesthetic.
