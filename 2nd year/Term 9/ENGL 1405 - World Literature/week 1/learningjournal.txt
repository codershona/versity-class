ANSWER:


Analyzing novels, whether fictional or otherwise, is a process that needs focus and accuracy. Whenever a reader analyzes the story, he must bear in mind that the novel needs the target thing, when it was written, the three main things:

1) Did the author convey the intended meaning to the readers? 

2) Does the story bearing anything? 

3) Were the characters inside the story achieving the desired goal within the story?  

It is necessary when examining the literature and discussing fiction, characters, and fairytale events from a sore point In every fiction story there are hidden invisible values that will be derived from the story being read. This means leaving emotions out of the story and trying to analyze and interpret them in an effective and good way (Campsall, 2017). Sometimes, assessments and life intentions in the stories may be of great importance and quite large as they are used in daily life because the effect of reading good books enables the reader to interact and communicate more with the surrounding community. (Bury, 2013).  

Writing in a manner that explains a character performs constructive analysis and thinking based on intelligence and confronting situations because not all stories and narratives contain purposeful and positive messages, sometimes novels contain uninspiring and negative messages, in these cases, the reader must extract, analyze and conclude effectively and well from the books reads them.
