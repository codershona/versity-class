Learning Journal Unit 5
We have read a number of short stories now in various genres. In order to truly understand literature, you need to write as well as read. For your Learning Journal you will write one short story from any of the genres we have covered (or will cover) this term. Note: This means to write your OWN story that YOU made up. Also, this is the SAME story that we will use to rewrite for the rest of the quarter.

This is your chance to write a complete work of original fiction. It can be as little as 400 words or as much as 800 words.  Anything under 400 words or over 800 words will be considered not a proper submission and the grade will be heavily affected.

ANSWER:

For this week’s discussion, I read the story “The Tell Tale Heart” by Edgar Allan Poe, told from the first-person viewpoint. The narrator is also the main character, who portrayed a person with a mental disorder. He expressed his admiration for his master, who treated him well, but he had a problem with the look of his blue eyes, which he described as vulture-like eyes. 


In Poe (1843) story, the narrator attempted to prove that he was not psychotic, trying to convince his audience that his illness had improved his senses and that he was aware of his actions as he planned everything.  He told of how every night around midnight, he quietly opened the door to watch the old man lying on his bed, but his eyes were always closed, which prevented him from carrying out his plan. Then, in the morning, he would call him by his name and ask him about his night.

On the eighth night, as usual, he cautiously opened the door and became aware of the complexity of his abilities, which was too much for him to handle.  As he moved toward his mission, he thought that the old man was unaware of his forbidden thoughts and deeds, and he smiled as a result. While trying to open the lantern, his thumb slipped, and the old man leapt out of bed, trying to find out who was there. The narrator stayed quiet for another hour while he imagined that the old man must have been thinking about several things that could have caused the noise.

A ray of light caused him to see the blue eyes that he dreaded, which angered him.  He noted that his keen senses were mistaken for madness. Poe (1843) intensifies the story as the narrator felt nervous, as the old man’s terror grew extreme, and it was time, as the anxiety seized him.

As expected in a mystery, Poe (1843) centres the plot around a crime and detectives as they looked for answers and tries to solve a mystery. The bulk of the suspense comes from deceiving clues, and the anticipation of solving the puzzle at a slow pace (Author Learning Center, n.d.).  This story could become a thriller if characters were named and the pace was faster, with a continuous sense of danger and excitement. There would be no need for investigations.
