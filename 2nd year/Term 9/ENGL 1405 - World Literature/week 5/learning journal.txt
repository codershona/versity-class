Learning Journal Unit 5
We have read a number of short stories now in various genres. In order to truly understand literature, you need to write as well as read. For your Learning Journal you will write one short story from any of the genres we have covered (or will cover) this term. Note: This means to write your OWN story that YOU made up. Also, this is the SAME story that we will use to rewrite for the rest of the quarter.

This is your chance to write a complete work of original fiction. It can be as little as 400 words or as much as 800 words.  Anything under 400 words or over 800 words will be considered not a proper submission and the grade will be heavily affected.

When it comes to the day of Ms Harbinsburg, every minute of every second of her day is meticulously planned. It is here where Ms. Harbinsburg picks up the daily outfit she wears as she begins the day, and I must say I have never seen a closet more ordered than that of the lovely woman. She already has the clothes arranged for her, so it wouldn't be accurate to say "pick" since her clothes are always arranged for the day, and today is Wednesday, so a cute little sundress would be appropriate. She had breakfast with eggs and also met her new "crush" Mr. Galowsworp, the manager of the cleaner manufacturer that she hired to provide her house with the latest, coolest cleaner every Wednesday. In her schedule, she has to go there every week despite not needing any cleaners and she must be quick as a moment can't be wasted and the tidy lady will meet the tidy man and she prepared herself and went. Again, I can confirm that everything went according to plan, including Ms. Harbinsburg following her rigorous schedule even on election day. 

The woman tells herself, "Life is short, so do what's necessary" and today's necessity is for Mr. Galowsworp to offer the brand new ultra maximum mop for 3,99, simply because it adds the word "ultra", she adds to her schedule. The way she's doing things makes sense to her because it's her schedule like being pretty and smiling, acting dumb and being attractive, like being in love to be happy. The schedule is in place, and she has been changing anything ever since she could remember, so her relationship with Mr. Galowsworp, being her "meant-to-be," also makes sense. Why? They wouldn't want that because of his reputation; he's loved furthermore. She assumes this is what she wants as well. He doesn't treat her too well though because he sells her overpriced mops and maybe a change of breakfast might be a good idea for him. Maybe wear spontaneous clothing or stop going to the same store every Wednesday stop and Ms. Harbinsburg is being nonsense again, claiming, Let's start all over again.


She constantly feels like her whole reality is a falsehood and everything she does go according to plan, and by according to plan, I mean that many things are wrong, that she's lost, that she's broken, that she's broken and that she's broken, and the lab erupts in gleeful cheers. When they collect enough information, Artificial Intelligence is capable of challenging their narrow and repeated virtual environments. In the case of models 10800, also known as "Ms Harbinsburg", it is demonstrated how a subject within a simulation can go insane or question their own mind in order to break the pattern. Humanity is now one step closer to finding out what their own reality is and whether or not we ourselves are trapped in the same 'schedules' as that of Ms. Harbinsburg.
