For your Discussion Assignment, you will explore the social construct of fear and horror. We each come from a different place and culture. Tell us, with 3-4 sentences, what legends of horror are special to your culture. In other words, how does your culture connect to horror and what do they find frightening. Focus on how the story you read fits in with your cultural identity of fear.

In addition, you must extend the discussion by responding to at least three (3) of your peersâ€™ postings in the Discussion Forum and by rating their posts. Instructions for proper posting and rating are provided inside the Discussion Forum for each week.

ANSWER:



Would you endanger losing a finger in consideration to win a fancy car? 'Man from the South' by Roald Dahl', it's a story that I read that has insisting tale about gambling that will make you flinch but at the end it gave cathartic aid for relief. 

The story brought a definite definition of horror story from my culture as a piece of lie in a prose of varying length that shoots or even fears the reader, or perhaps triggers feelings of refusal or loss (Cuddon, 1984, page 11). 

I think psychologically the anxiety of the fear of death is what is found mostly frightening in horror stories or movies.
