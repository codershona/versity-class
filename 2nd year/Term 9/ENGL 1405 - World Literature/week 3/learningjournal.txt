ANSWER:


This story relates well with my community The Call of Cthulhu by H. P. Lovecraft; (http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cc.aspx)


Horror creates unnecessary fears of the unknown. Taking a moment to envision the dead walkingdrops chills in my spine. From the story I read, I now believe that fear is a great torment and can easily kill someone if the resource is put in perspective. Anything to do with death scares people including myself, but not to the extent of making fear control my vision to the point of psychosis.The study of horror is a very important and requisite aspect in pedantic, because it helps us discover other people’s cultures knowing that different cultures perceive horror and fear in different ways. 



Living deep in the countryside we are bombarded with a couple of mystical fears and horror. Children in my profession take a long time before they are exposed to society, due to the fears of witchcraft. Some of my community members have been passive having evil eyes, and if by chance they view the infants, a couple of diseases or even death follows the young children. Before these infants are exposed to the outside world, several rites have to be performed to protect them from witchcraft. This fictionalized fear that has trapped my community members really puzzles me. 


The legend of horror in my community is the noisy spirit brought by the night runners. This might sound like fiction but it is what happens in my community. These night-runners run aroundpeople's houses throwing stones on rooftops and windows and chanting unknown words causing the family members to get in to hypnosis. mostly they come around the compound when there is a fresh grave. It is believed that they order the dead person to wake up in the weird hours of the night, and they order the dead to walk with them to the river bed where they are eaten raw. by chance if you happen to confront them you also die. In the morning family members find the grave of their loved one’s empty. This action brings horror to my community, and frightens me. 


Taking into circumstance the story I read this week, the witchcraft in my community is like the Cthulhu in the story who’s powerful and creates fear. Cthulhu is immoral and has great strength and can only be killed by mystical almighty power just like the witchcraft in my community who are powerful because they practice black magic. My reaction to fictionalized horror is this fictionends up corrupting the mind to believe in time the events are true. fiction with time feels real.
