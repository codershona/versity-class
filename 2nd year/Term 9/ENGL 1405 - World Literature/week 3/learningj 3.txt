Learning Journal Unit 3
For this Learning Journal, we will build upon the Discussion Assignment. You already shared what your culture connects to horror, now tell me how you see yourself and your community react to fictionalized horror. What frightens you? The word limit is 250 words.

ANSWER:

In my opinion, horror literature and videos are like Pandora's Boxes. I used to be curious when someone talked about a scary story, yet I always regret knowing one after I discovered it. Although I never forget the images, I still remember the clips I watched with my classmates, which not only made me fear darks for over a week, but I also became the class scariest cat, so my family and friends avoided recommending fictionalized horror to me.

In my community, people do not like fictionalized horror but still do not recommend them because they will confuse children. Since I spend most of my time at church, I am not used to fictionalizing horror. Famous horror literature, such as Edgar Poes' writings, is recommended for readers and while classic horror literature is less important than the more recent ones, there are some great poems, old words, and good expressions in this literature that make it worth reading.

While reading horror, I am terrified by the descriptions and the mental images I create in my head, as well as certain things that I see in the story that tend to haunt me. Mirror-gazing reminds me of a ghost similar to the character in the fiction, so the fiction was the worst Pandora's box I have ever opened, and now I can't stare into the mirror for more than ten seconds. Horror is the worst genre for me compared to other fiction, although there are some classics worth reading because certain professional words are only used in horror stories.
