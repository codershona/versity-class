Learning Journal Unit 3
For this Learning Journal, we will build upon the Discussion Assignment. You already shared what your culture connects to horror, now tell me how you see yourself and your community react to fictionalized horror. What frightens you? The word limit is 250 words.

ANSWER:


Horror literature and videos are like a pandora box for me. I get curious when someone is talking a scary story or read the title of a book. However, every time I know one, I always regret it. The images never leave my head. I still remember the clips I watched with my classmates, which made me fear darks for over a week. I was the worst scary cat in my familyand friends, so they hardly recommended me fictionalized horrors.

I spend most of the time with my church people, so my community does not welcome fictionalized horror. They do not recommend horror tales because it will give confusion to thechildren. However, famous horror literature like Edgar Poes' writing is recommended. The classic horror literature is not that crucial than the recent ones. Some poems, old words, and great expressions in those writing make it valuable for reading. 

Things that frighten me are the descriptions and the images I draw in my head when I read horror. Also, certain things that come out in the story gets stuck in my head. Staring at the mirror reminds me of a ghost who acts the same as the fictions' character. That fiction was theworst pandora box I have ever opened. Now, I can not stare my eye in the mirror for over ten seconds.

For me, horror is the worst genre compared to others. However, some classic ones are worth reading because some professional words are only used in horror literature.
