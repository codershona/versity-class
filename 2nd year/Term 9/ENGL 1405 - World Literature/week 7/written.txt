For this assignment, you are to tell any fairy tale you heard while growing up. Do NOT copy and paste something from the internet. Tell, in 2-3 paragraphs, what the story is about and what connection you have to it. This can be anything from a memory as a child or even a deeper meaning found as an adult.


ANSWER:

In the spirit of the holiday season, one fairy tale that I heard while growing up is the concept of "Santa Claus". A heftier, older man lives at the North Pole with his wife, Mrs. Claus. He has a factory with elves as his employees and all they do each year, up until Christmas Eve, is makes toys for all of the little good girls and boys (and stock up on coal for the bad ones). When December comes around, he's at every mall, with kids coming to sit on his lap and asking them what they want for Christmas. Then, when Christmas Eve comes around, Santa readies his sleigh with all of the gifts (and coal) and flies, with the help of his nine reindeer, to each and every home of the good and bad little girls and boys. He lands on the roofs of houses, goes down the chimney (or through the front door if they don't have a chimney) andputs their presents (or coal) under the tree and/or in their stockings. If milk and cookies is left out for him, he will also eat them.The connection that I had to it, as a child, is that the magic of Christmas was alive and well and that I would get presents for Christmas if I was a good girl. As an adult however, those thoughts took a complete turn for the opposite. I knew that my parents, relatives and every type of mail/package delivery truck out there were the true "Santa Claus" and the fact that how can someone that old fly, travel to every house since new real estate is always being built, go down chimneys and back up chimneys and no one is none the wiser? Plus, the whole "making a list, checking it twice" and "he sees you when you're sleeping, he knows when you're awake" bits also make me think: "how would he know of every child on this Earth?" and "isn't that just a bit creepy/stalker-ish?", respectively. Plus, he can't be at every mall on Earth at once. I just find it a shame that we are all told these lies as kids instead of the truth.
