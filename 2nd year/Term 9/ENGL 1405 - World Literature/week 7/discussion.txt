ANSWER:


'The Surprise' by Lili Potpara tells the story of a girl who is given a bike by her father who purchased it via credit. She wanted something else instead of the gift, so she wasn't satisfied. In the story, I imagined the tension between the mother and father, which is present in every household. According to Potpara (n.d.), the mother and father were not communicating and there was silence in the home. Moreover, the father bought the bicycle with a loan, which indicates the family is struggling financially. While reading the story, the image of a house void of things or furniture also came into my mind. "Potpara" mentioned that the silence was deep and heavy and that it sometimes echoed. There is nothing to digest sound in empty rooms in houses, so there are echoes. Furthermore, I am reminded of the image of a disappointed little girl. The girl was disappointed because she wanted a pony instead of a bicycle (Potpara, n.d.).
