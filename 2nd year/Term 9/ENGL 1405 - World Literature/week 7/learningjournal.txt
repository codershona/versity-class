Learning Journal Unit 7
You have written and re-visioned a story of your own design. For this Learning Journal, you will pick a new genre that you haven’t used and re-create your story yet again. This time, however, you will use only 1-3 sentences to tell the entire story. This is an exercise in Micro-Fiction and the ability to analyze a plot structure and boil it down to a logline.

For example, the movie Terminator can be ‘boiled down’ to one sentence: A man from a dystopian future is sent back in time to stop a killer android from destroying the unborn leader of the resistance.


ANSWER:


For the last journal of this term, I am writing about a ghost without a body, but only with shoes. At some female secondary schools in Bangladesh, the mystery of seasonal ghosts surfaces during the summer season without knowing their origin. The kind of ghosts that exist is not known; you can only see or hear two shoes going through corridors and upstairs, and no one has ever been able to see this ghost while remaining the same. According to legend, the ghost is usually the spirit of a teacher who was mistreated at the school and who returns annually either to scare or to engage in unknown activities.
