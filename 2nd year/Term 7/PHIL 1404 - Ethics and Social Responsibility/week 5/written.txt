ANSWER:


INTRODUCTION:

The concept of fair trade arose in the mid-twentieth century as a means of providing farmers and farm workers around the world with employment benefits similar to thosefound in developed nations" (Jimenez & Pulos, 2016). Primary fair trade operates as acertification system under which qualified producers that is producers who follow certain environmental and labor standards are guaranteed a minimum price for their production (Jimenez & Pulos, 2016).

1. After studying this chapter, are you more likely or less likely to buy fair trade    coffee? Why or why not? 

After reading this chapter I'm more likely to buy fair trade coffee. This is because the "price guaranteed by fair trade augment and stabilizes the revenues of producers in developing countries, so that they can invest in social welfare infrastructure and environmentally friendly farming methods" (Jimenez & Pulos, 2016). Fair Trade coffees are also produced through environmentally friendly and  sustainable farming practices free from child labor. Even though fair trade may not be perfect, there is at least some regulations in place that ensure not only the promoting of economic development for developing countries, but also ensure food is secure through the audits performed (Jimenez, & Pulos, 2016). It may not be consistent, but let’s face it, not everything in this world is perfect, for as long as we recognized mistakes and improve on them, surely, some credit is deserved.

2. Is there another way of achieving the objectives of improving the lives of    developing-country farmers and producers than the Fair Trade approach? Describe at least one option. 

Yes and no the reasons being, firstly, if there was a better option it would be in existence. I am saying this because it looks like free trade consists of all examples of ethical responsibility for companies to follow. Even though there may be inconsistencies, but that’s why there are free trade organizations, to ensure these inconsistencies are back in line. The organizations implementing these fair trade organization may not be perfect too, but regulations are in place as I said before. Instead of us trying to find a better alternative for now, why not we utilize what we have? Fix the loopholes and ensure that the current Fair trade organizations work on their inconsistencies. We could also create more awareness about fair trade, so that wehave more people participate and invigorate this movement, because it does not only work in the favor of developing countries, but also in that of developed countriessince food is grown more naturally which means it is less toxic or not genetically modified, and that’s that basis of fair trade (economic growth for the developing countries while the developed countries receive quality fair trade products). However, I also think that  there is another way of achieving the objectives of improving the lives of developing-country farmers and producers than the Fair Trade approach through the support of the government. In order to ensure that the life of farmers and agricultural production is substantial may require the government to build or improve infrastructure such as roads that connect the market (city) to farms or factories for easy transportation of agricultural crops and produces, provide the children of farmerswith free tuition, grant low or no interest loan to farmers and subsidized medical care farmers and their families.


3. Why do consumers buy Fair Trade products? List a few reasons and analyze  each of them. 

According to the article, consumers buy Fair Trade products so as to ensure similar employment benefits of farmers and their workers as those in the developed world (Jimenez, & Pulos, 2016). This then works in s transitive favor to the economy of the developing countries.  Fair trade is also promoted as an initiative to reward principled or organized production in the developing country (Jimenez, & Pulos, 2016).  This in turn motivates farmers and their farm workers to produce more, at a level of ethics. Finally consumers also buy Fair Trade products because it motivates the principles that producers that are qualified are guaranteed a minimum price for production (Jimenez, & Pulos, 2016). This means that these producers are financially secured (Stabilize revenue), and this could help their productivity.

Conclusion:

The ultimate goal of fair trade is to make life better for those involved in the process of planting and harvesting coffee. Especially people in the developing world
