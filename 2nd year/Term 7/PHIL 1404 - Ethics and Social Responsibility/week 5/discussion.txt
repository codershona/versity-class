Hi everyone,

Please read the opinion articles from Chapter 9 of the Corporate Social Responsibility textbook that you find in the reading assignment.

Based on what you have learned in this unit, answer the following questions:

When you buy clothing do you check the inside label to see where the item was manufactured? Would it matter to you to discover that an item was manufactured in Bangladesh?
If you found an article of clothing that had a label stating that it was manufactured in the United States, would this make it more attractive to you? What if the item was 20% or 30% more expensive, would that keep you from buying it?
What is the best way to make sure the workers in factories are treated fairly? Can you come up with one detailed proposal?


ANSWER:


ANSWER 1:

Yes, I always check where the product was manufactured. I did not know about the textile industries in Bangladesh. All along I have loved buying clothing labelled made in Bangladesh without knowing how factory workers are treated there. “As well as earning a pittance, Bangladeshi factory workers face appalling conditions. Many are forced to work 14-16 hours a day seven days a week, with some workers finishing at 3am only to start again the same morning at 7.30am.” (War on Want, 2015, para 3). What happens in clothing factories of Bangladesh is heartbreaking. I am not sure how I’ll react this time if I come across such items. Chances are that my emotions may get the better of me. However, these things I have no control over them so whether to or not to buy clothing from Bangladesh will not change the working conditions for the workers. Those with power are the ones who can change.


ANSWER 2: 


If I found an article of clothing that had a label stating that it was manufactured in the United States, it would not be attractive to me. According to Fashion United, Westen buyers demand arbitary discounts, often postpone payments to manufacturers, and manufactures have a little to say about this unethical behavior of buyers. (Henkel, 2020) This has made me not to find American clothing not attractive. They import clothes at a cheap price but they sell clothes at a ridiculous price. Also in South Africa, clothes that are labeled made in the United States are expensive while local brands are affordable hence it implies that clothing made in the US are meant for rich people.


If the item is 20% or 30% more expensive, I would still not buy because I’m sure I could get a similar itemfor less price.

ANSWER 3:

The best way to make sure that factory workers are treated fairly is by:

- Ensuring that there are inspectors checking up on these factories even if it means someone outside the firm who may not take sides. The inspector would inspect if there aren’t children employed, if there aren’t human rights being violated within the factory, and also to check if they earn enough salary.

- Forcing a shutdown on companies that keep on importing clothes from countries especially Bangladesh despite knowing that workers aren’t treated well. It means that these companies only care about profits yet they don’t consider the workers working conditions.

- The government should make sure that workers aren’t treated badly in factories. The government should ensure that those who unfairly treat workers should be brought to book.

- Workers should be also educated so that they know where to report and they should learn to voice their concerns to whoever is responsible for workers like worker’s union
