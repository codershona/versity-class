Dear Future Leaders,

Please read the case study “Falling Out of the Middle Class” from the chapter 8 of the Business ethics textbook that you find in the reading assignment.

Based on what you have learned in this unit, answer the following questions:

Does a company have an ethical duty to find a balance between remaining profitable and paying all workers a decent living wage? Why or why not?
Who decides what constitutes a fair wage?
How would you explain to a board of directors your decision to pay entry-level workers a higher wage than required by law?


Answer:

Definitely, here I want to talk about the efficient approach which can develop any company's advantage, which is a legal duty to keep a balance of the benefits as well as it can allow you all workers a correct living wage. The reason is workers who live better living income can hold extra possible to be effective. Therefore, it can be also guided lesser assuring to freedom. The lower attrition the factor which have secondary recruitment, and practice costs as well as stronger workers. This method also can assist to improve brand reputation as the customers need to be rising more which is averse to the working situations about the above-mentioned products which can be good deal by balancing good living wage along with the company’s advantage which would assist to decrease the company’s cost. Workers on the junior level are depending on the advantages of wage to live down. But wherever they collect a good living wages of the company that put up the divide the advantage of expenses. (Ethical trading initiative, n.d)


As stated in the information which I was reading where the business holder makes agree on how the good salary is. Relying on the way a business can be done if they could boost the lowest wage over the national, lowest salary. This can be fulfilled along the encouragement where the business would develop as well as build up the economy. It would be to bring a great advantage for everyone in conjunction with the entity in the midst class. Companies like Starbucks, Gap, Benz Jerry can take place by developing their salary margin. There will be not any logical particular for all that profession relationship which can not be held back which had employees right for a good salary. (Byars & Stanberry, 2019). The way good qualities had been resolved to debate in public. The particular difference where placed on the aspect where it can appear in calculations like federal or state lowest salary rules. The government is liable for this implements of the good wages. 

Up to now, by talking about the board, I would like to arrange a report which can be bring us a proof which is substituted like expenses or the net. I would like to look at the great hit on the business whenever it added on. Uncertainly, my if we argument that it could be placed on this area as well as in the economic circumstances by falling in the limited economy like buying power where it had easy operation. Without poverty which is balanced more income falling within peoples live a in the way they contribute into the company. The economic records have been analysis that the staff competency had guidance into local economy. The growth has projections which was like the adjustments can be implements which can be most silly portrayal that effects of the change. It can also pay employees supportable salary which has a great driver of countries in economy. The financial sector would not boost when the compensation was decreasing and the business would not survive in the long run by not having a proper growth. In a word, we can say that, by well paying for junior workers with the lowest wages charged by law advantages among the employee and the company. This can also increase the consumer costs, which has advantages for the entire economy.
