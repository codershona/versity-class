ANSWER:

What impact will labeling of GM food products have on producers and developers of GMOfoods?

People all around the world are gaining awareness on what is good for their health and that which causes damage to the body. People read the packaging of the products to ascertain the ingredients and expiry dates. Here in Kenya, people are avoiding foods that are considered GMOs simply because they believe that such food is modified using chemicals that are harmful to the body and may cause medical problems if ingested over a long period of time. This affects the companies involved adversely in terms of sales and eventually leads to closure of the establishments.Due to the labeling, consumers will be able differentiate between organic and modified foods. This will lead to an improvement in organic food farming and production as well as an increase in the demand for organic foods in the markets.

The labelling of foods to differentiate whether organic or modified will bring about the need to find better ways of selling GMO foods and best markets that will promote the sale of genetically modified foods.

C. et al., 2016).Labeling will also lead to growth and research in the GMO industry as more and more people gain awareness of the products. This will encourage and form fertile ground for more research into other different products that can be genetically modified.
