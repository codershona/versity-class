Chapter: Professional Ethics, Work Environments & Marketing Ethics

For this week’s assignment, I am going to address the concept of Job-sharing positions in certain departments, as well as benefits and downsides to this type of employment. I will also highlight the motivations for the need of job-sharing positions. A job-sharing position is a position where two individuals are hired part-timely, replacing the full time position (). 


What points support the job-sharing plan?  


The job sharing plan has been backed by the facts that some people may use the time off for them to care for their children, or an elderly person, pursuit of education, run a side business, or volunteer for a good cause. Job-sharing allows for a well enhance work-life balance, due to the extra time off (Byars, & Stanberry, 2019). Job sharers are not likely to be absent due to the flexible working standard that allows them enough time off for family, emergencies as well as leisure (Byars, & Stanberry, 2019).


How would it benefit the company? The employees? 


In return the company, will not have sharers that report stress, and are able to be competent at their best to produce excellent results (Byars, & Stanberry, 2019). Another gain is the “More is accomplished in a shorter working period for job-sharers, than full-time individuals, according to the textbook” (Byars, & Stanberry, 2019). In a business where two individuals are hired to fill one position allows employers to find talented individuals with the right skills or talent. Another gain is that, a retiring job-sharers leave room for training new individuals to replace them (Byars, & Stanberry, 2019). Replacing a full time position with a part-time one allows the employ to avoid paying for benefits that are entitled by a full time employee (And this is ethical is the business is quite small or if the financial standings of the company are not stable).

What negative effects might it have on the company and the employees? 


The first downside to job-sharing is that, not all job fields are suited for this type of position (Byars, & Stanberry, 2019). Secondly, work may suffer if the extra time has not been made up to (having incompetent individuals fill in this position) (Byars, & Stanberry, 2019). Which brings us to the third downside, employees need to be sure that the individuals to be hired can actually do the jobs, especially if their resumes don’t seem clear (how can they trust, hiring the person?). Four, competitive behaviour between employees can lead to greediness with information (e.g. to maintain my sales performance I don’t have to show my partner m methods of selling) or even sabotaging the whole project, when ironically, they milk from the same cow (Byars, & Stanberry, 2019). Five, “the ‘Mondays effect’, this is a situation where by an individual has to catch-up with work on the first day back, after their partner, this time spent can lead to low productivity” (Byars, & Stanberry, 2019). And last, but not least, some managers want independent but productive individuals, dealing with two individuals can add to the burden of having to manage the team actively (Byars, & Stanberry, 2019). 


Do you have any concerns about potential employment discrimination if this plan is implemented? 

If so, what would they be? Yes, I do have concerns, as even the textbook states that, the hot question comes down to whether the employer is hiring job sharers to increase productivity or just hiring part-time worker to improve profitability and avoid employee benefits. Concerns for potential employment discrimination would be the segregation between full-time and par-time workers would lead to undermining of the other group. It would then lead to questions of whether full-time employees are doing a job that require more than one person, and transitively result would be tension around the workplace. As the textbook says that, “employees could claim discrimination if the flexitime is not in a precise and well-written policy” (Byars, & Stanberry, 2019). 


Is creating job-sharing positions the right thing for the company/customers/employees to do in this situation? 


In this situation, the company is quite small, isn’t doing so well and unemployment rate is high, so creating such positions would help put a lot of people put food on the table. The manager may seem desperate, but other factors are into play, such as high unemployment cash flow (Byars, & Stanberry, 2019). The marketing department could do well with a diversified work force and that is perfect for job-sharing. The final answer would be that creating the job-sharing positions would be right for this company, with consideration to the above factors.


Conclusion:

Job-sharing positions, depends on the company’s Status (circumstances), unemployment rate ( for example if the unemployment rate is quite high, a company can give at least two to three people the same job to share, rather than hire one person who may need bonuses on this helps cut down unemployment rates). Such positions may prove to be highly beneficial in certain departments, so employers need to be wise before deciding.
