ANSWER:

In the beginning, we can not Compete the arguments without serving the barrier act that can secure the company data and important information for their competitors without not barring hired not to work any types of employment roles are as the present one for each period and not making time limitation for the perimeters for the business. 

In my own opinion, I do not trust that, work competitors should compelled by waiting for the positive period and make hope that came for one time in life and no organization would do under legal standards from connection. 

Furthermore, compete with others means a business which compete to row more and learn from their competitors. If I give an example, here we can imagine that, while I am doing a business in secret way and I never research market and I do not have any competitors on the market I can try to follow my other competitors to learn in other ways. Suppose, I had a food cafe business and I give advertise in online to promote my business. Here I need to try what my business I need to improve for well sale which I do not know yet. I need to hire some skilled workers who can deliver their skills into my business and make innovative thinking for my business and make well promotion. While not having any competition for my service which I am delivering for customers it would drag a huge lose in my business. We need to focus that we need to make happy for our each customer and give opportunity for skills workers to work in my company.  


A company can able to bring for your clients in a great way if they implement well ideas in their business. With barring any hired people we can stop this kind of growth which company highly needs and legally speaking as an employee who knows their company well they can work more flexibility to deliver good quality of work.         

Last but not least, the legally way if we think one can not hold to secure the sensitive data and we that employee leave everything would be hold behind. I can also determine that the company or business growth not only depends on skills it also depends on sincerity.
