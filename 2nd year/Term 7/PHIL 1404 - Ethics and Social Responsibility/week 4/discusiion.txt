Dear CSR associates,

Please read the case study entitled “Insider Trading and Fiduciary Duty” from the chapter 7 "Financial Integrity" of the Business Ethics textbook that you find in the reading assignment.

Based on what you have learned in this unit, answer the following questions:

Employers in financial services must have stringent codes of professional behavior for their employees to observe. Even given such a code, how should employees honor their fiduciary duty to safeguard the firm’s assets and treat clients equitably? What mechanisms would you suggest for keeping employees in banking, equities trading, and financial advising within the limits of the law and ethical behavior?
This case dominated the headlines in the 1980s and the accused in this case were all severely fined and received prison sentences. How do you think this case might be treated today?
Should employees in these industries be encouraged or even required to receive ethical certification from the state or from professional associations? Why or why not?
