Dear Thinkers,

Please read the case study entitled “Three Forms of Justice” from the chapter 2 of the Business Ethics textbook. Based on what you have learned in this unit, answer the following questions:

How is the ancient concept of distributive justice understood in today’s political debate?
What are the underlying values that inform each side of the debate (e.g., values like wealth maximization and corporate social responsibility)?
Can these sides be reconciled and, if so, what must happen to bring them together? Does virtue have a role to play here; if so, how?



ANSWER:

In this week the lesson needs to bought in my mind in various things which can affect that the reality in our countries we are also facing this situation. There was a justice which has frequent moral angle of those topics. Here if we review we will see in somewhere that the ethics was a function which has been guided principle of the relations with others. This was also referred by the economic and social and political structure in this context of the equal distribution of the advantages or resources between the members of the community.  These methods were distributive for the justice and now we need to leave many rooms for the famous equity. The more goods such as land, sea-coast, and public buildings of the society was to belong to the states. The most citizen was important to ask for the governmental authorities so that it can access rightfully. The two of the things was many we do not require putting for the social scale in our city. The universal health coverage as well as universal health coverage were also eligible to make social security. The greater means in the private sector needs to buy the high price we were free to less the fortunate. While we can also talk to regarding the men in the power such as senators or deputies and this was to utilize for the resources of the public treasury for the personal and family affairs. While the candidate can also make assure that, we can update the constitution as well as the laws to make the elimination of the judicial of the system. Also, make enriched himself on this population. Moreover, we can attribute for this person and make its value. We can also complete the ethics value for each of the following cases. The variable of the justice of the distributive needs the framework which can make differences in social actors and has wealth maximization of the management. This can also develop the values of the distributive which was more than the CSR and it was not for the making money for the shareholders. This is also possible to protect the interests of the stakeholders for example, employees, or customers or suppliers. This actually operated by these companies. We can also achieve the successful type of the distributive of the justice that was not the matter of the boosting the commercial wealth of the shareholders. Business leaders also need to recognize the fair value of the people like customers and employees. 

In my own opinion, the all stakeholders' interests need to be protected and the role of the virtue can be aspect by the valued of the moral guidance to make supports for each and every forms for the government and social policy in every country.
