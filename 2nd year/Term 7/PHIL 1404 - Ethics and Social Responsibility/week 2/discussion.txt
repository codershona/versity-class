Dear Thinkers,

Please read the case study entitled “Three Forms of Justice” from the chapter 2 of the Business Ethics textbook. Based on what you have learned in this unit, answer the following questions:

How is the ancient concept of distributive justice understood in today’s political debate?
What are the underlying values that inform each side of the debate (e.g., values like wealth maximization and corporate social responsibility)?
Can these sides be reconciled and, if so, what must happen to bring them together? Does virtue have a role to play here; if so, how?



ANSWER:
