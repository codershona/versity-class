Dear Critical Thinkers,

Please read the reading materials from Chapter 7 of the Corporate Social Responsibility textbook that you find in the reading assignment.

Based on what you have learned in this unit, answer the following questions:

Does this chapter increase or decrease your motivation to consume organic food products? Explain why.
What is a more important motivation—in your view—for consuming organic food: a) that it is better for your health, or b) that it is better for the environment and for farm workers? Explain.
Let us say that, instead of a hospital as our case study example, we had used the example of a wealthy private school for K–12 students. Would the argument be stronger or weaker for adopting organic food in the cafeteria of the school? Why?


ANSWER:

1. In my own point of the view, when we review this lesson it does not make any affect in my personal choice to eat normally. I would like to have regular products which are 100% organic and it makes a various in the price among the two. 

2. In my second point of view, it is also necessary to motivate people to eat organic food. We also should prevent pollution with pesticides. Moreover, soil is our wealth we need to take care of it. If the human wants to keep releasing in soil with chemicals we can go for the point of the infertile. The plants need to grow and does not affect our future generations. 

3. In my third point of view, I trust that we can make a budget to make afford the organic foods for schools students and in this case, the hospital can be mentioned that they do not have any 100% organic meals budgets for all students. The reason is we need to push cost for per night for hospitalization and the competitors can trust it.
