We can also disagree with people in some point of view, by adding the old clothes make the man. But the research shows that, well-dresses needs the employees which can be held in their higher esteem and make who dress down. We can also consider that, the movie industry that make dress codes and put actors feel more character in each project that they can play. We can put the right clothes for the performance and bought up the entire new level to transform the actor within the character. If there is specific dress codes and employers have behavior based on their standards which would be suit in their roles and makes mandatory dress code and behaviors. 

Why are these standards important (or not) from an ethical perspective?

If the standard cloths to make an impact on each person thinking and this is also necessary to make sense which makes and individual feeling and confidence. Many researchers show that, by dressing professionally it helps to increase the thinking ability abstractly as well as it would give you broader of the perspective. We can also illustrate that, we can wear any uniforms to make people could make more conscious in their duties and make encourage them to pay more responsible in their duty time. They can wear uniforms in the school laboratory and wear a lab coat while experimenting in the laboratory and this would make the student felt like there were professional scientists or doctors. Lab coat basically will represent the seriousness and make attentive to students.

It would make elevation in any creative thinking and people will think more creatively and make them happy to be free in good ethics. It can also turn the outcome in our work to be highest quality. We make collaboration in the workplace and be happy and make Standardization for our international company of the dress code to reinforces the employees in any company. We can illustrate that, if the Toyota company has employees who have professional uniforms that would enforce to make sense to attend and make clients in every company standard and make a comparison to not wear the company uniform. 


CONCLUSION

As a result, we trust that make the dress in the proper way so that anyone would like to tuck professionally and it looks better or not it does not matter. The dress code needs to be present for any person to make real communicate the volumes with the other person.
