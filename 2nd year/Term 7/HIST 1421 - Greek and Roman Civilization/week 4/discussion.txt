ANSWER:


In the beginning, taken away by the readings, we can see that, Latium has a league that formed nearby Latin City-States as well as Rome asked for unite for them in exchange for aid the growth of their empires. Rome also tried and true to contact or join with Latin Cities as well as located by the Volsci, Sabine, Etruria, Aequi, and Campania. To delighted these cities, we can care the big positive clash on Roman Government. They also wanted to utilize those cities for the war to make the defeat of its enemies during the time that, Latium towns can depend on other cities at that time of the war. If we read chapter 10, we can also check that, Rome has secure to make a connection between Samnites and Latin League to make a band together by the treaty equal alliance that was rolled by the Sp. The Latin however Cassius states was worried because Rome needed to regain its dominance. Latin cities can have a rich soil and many people were having caretaker and farmers. These cities also can help to make an advance in the economy of Roman Government. Rome needs to be choosy enough to handle those cities and states and make unity with them which could impact for their empire without sympathy. In the chapter 10 there was another evidenced that Latiumcities can be sent an embassy to Rome and make appeal of Roman and Latins which was linked with one republic. Romans never try to accept this and Manlius which are called the senator has been declared that has twinge and the start of Latin accepted to the association. I had also thought that, if we avoid intruders including a kingdom has been divided against to make failure and try to protect and secure the affair enclosed by internal regime.
