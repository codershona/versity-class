If you had the choice to live in Athens or Sparta, which one would you choose and why?


ANSWER:

In the beginning, I am going to talk about my own choice whether it was the place to live if I would choose to reside in Sparta. The reason is in Sparta there are superior where it has to make their army in Athens and it was protective for women to received education and freedom. But in poleis it was possible to get tis advantages for women. Moreover if I live in Sparta contrary of Athens, their army were they having powerful fighter force in Greek. In the starting age of seven, the young boys were sent to join military barracks and they need to live there without their families. They trained them and try to make them tough in this case, they can able to make them stronger fighter force and prepare them for the war also. This is the reason I want to live in Sparta and it was very safest cities in the Greek. Moreover, women would get opportunities to learn more than the Athens. In Athens girls are only allowed to teach from their mothers. But in Sparta they can get well education system and get involve in sports also such as, javelin as well as running. They trust that this helps to make them stronger and make their mothers better. In Sparta women has freedom and it is recognized as the greatest polis of ancient Greek. Here women can able to own their own property and run their own businesses. They can also able to leave their house without taking permission from their husband but in Athens it was not possible. 

In conclusion, Sparta is a great city state of ancient Greek where I would like to visit and as I am a women I can freedom to move from one place to another and this city is also secure for women. Because women are equal to men and people are also forced into military but still it has good polis.
