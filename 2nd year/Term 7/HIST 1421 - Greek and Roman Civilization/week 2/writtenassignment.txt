Introduction

Ancient Greece was split into several hundred poleis, or city-states. Athens and Sparta were themost prominent, influential, powerful, and biggest nations among these poleis. Several otherstates included Sikyon, Corinth, Thebes, Argos, Mykenae, Delphi, and Olympia. Different stateswere   governed   by   various   forms   of   governance,   including   oligarchy,   monarchy,   despotism,democracy, and aristocracy.


Monarchy

Monarchy is the reign of a single king whose authority is hereditary. Monarchy originated inancient Greece circa 2000 BC. (2015) (Kokemuller). Macedonia, Corinth, and Epeiros were allfamous monarchy nations. In this political system, the monarch had absolute power, but somewere sympathetic toward the populace and shared limited authority in the Assembly. After 700BC, Greece lacked monarchy.


Aristocracy

Aristocracy is a term that refers to government by a relatively small privileged elite or a minoritycomprised of people deemed most competent to rule (Encyclopedia Britannica Inc). This systemwas  created on  the   premise that an aristocratic government should   be controlled by a   smallnumber of the most competent aristocrats. Qualified citizens might rise to the level of aristocat inthis society. Prior to 507 B.C., Athens was controlled by aristocracy. However, they manipulatedthe system such that minorities could not defeat them


Tyranny

Tyranny was a one-man dictatorship. In contrast to a benign ruler, a tyrant punished his subjectsseverely. The majority of rulers were corrupt former soldiers. They would look for a chance todestabilize the administration and grab control. Around 600 BC, tyrannies began to appear inancient   Greece   (Kokemuller,   2015).   However,   just   a   few   dictators   were   truly   benign.Pesisistratos  in Athens (about 560 BCE), Pheidon in Argos (around 660 BCE), Periander inCorinth (circa 657-585 BCE), and others were notable tyrants. (2013) (Cartwright)


Oligarchy

Oligarchy is a term that refers to "ruling by a few". Sparta was an oligarchy in ancient Greece. Inthis   system,   a   small   number   of   aristocrats   seized   power   and   exercised   control   over   thegovernment. The vast majority of folks were unable to engage in this system. Slaves, women,and foreigners were prohibited from participating in politics. This was another severe governancesystem, similar to tyranny. Sparta's oligarchy was controlled by two kings (descended from twoprivileged houses) and an elder council known as 'Gerousia'.



Democracy

Athens is credited with founding ancient democracy. During the ancient period (800–500 BCE),a  man   called  Solon  changed Athens'  political  structure  and   founded  democracy.  After  then Cleisthenes   (a   popular   aristocrat)   restored  Athens'   democratic   system.   His   system,   dubbed"Isonomia" or "Equality before the law," evolved into "demokratia," or "rule of the people."Athens was governed by direct democracy. Numerous countries' modern political systems aremodeled   after   the   ancient   Athenian   democracy.   However,   modern   democracies   prohibitdiscrimination between men and women or slaves and non-slaves. As a result, each person hasthe political right to vote. Rather than direct democracy, the current system elects members fromcertain areas


Conclusion


While all of the ancient Greek governance systems have been severely critiqued, we cannotdispute their contribution to contemporary civilisation. Today, democracy is acknowledged in amajority of the world's countries, including those to which ancient Greece gave birth.
