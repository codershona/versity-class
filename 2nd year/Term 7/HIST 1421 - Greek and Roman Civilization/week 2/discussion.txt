ANSWER:

In the beginning, I am going to discuss about the Cleisthenes’ where it has improved to buy Athens and it needs close to democracy and the Pericles needs to play the dominant role to promote the participation of the citizens with it and take a political decision. Athens has a large citizens' participation in their political life and it experienced the police because as we know in the Athenians women, children and slaves are banned from the political life. Athens has poor man and it is not shameful for them. The Greek Democracy needs the main developers to make the precursor to modern democracy. The democratic system needs an improvement so that by given their contribution he actively pushed the people to participate in political polis life. So, as a result we also can not ignore these words as their city is known as democracy and the reason is it has governed in many ways but there is no limitation. Moreover, in the real life scenario, the private disputes and it laws need to equality and this has public honors for each man, which was not prefer to not have the basis classes to make good reputation and his merit. To show it in another way, the Pericles his strength which is including with the ability to make people motivated. We can also called him a great contributor in the Athens for his democracy and golden age. Nonetheless, Pericles was convicted for the  β ις (hybris). In my own opinion, he can able to buy the war for the ὕ ϱPersians. For this reason, the Delian League creator needs to show that the Athens do not want allies and the subject poleis. But the only subject was considered. The Ionian coast as well as the Aegean in the Greek City-States were not were considered. Pericles was the main convicted for the fact, which was leading to end of the democracy in the Greece. The decrease of the Greek democracy has the Peloponnesian war and many Pericles died. The Athens has been that lost against Sparta. The broken of the role was for the Athens. The Pericles was the symbol for the end of the democracy and he was a hero for the gold age of Athenians. In the beginning of the modern world the Athen democracy will be destined to rise again and give us the boundless augmentation.
