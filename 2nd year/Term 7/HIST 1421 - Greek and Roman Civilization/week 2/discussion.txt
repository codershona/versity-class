ANSWER:


Even though we know that Cleisthenes’ reforms brought Athens in its way towards democracy, Pericles played a predominant role in promoting citizens participation in political decisions (Brand, n.d.). We know that Athenians excluded women, children and slaves from political life. However, no other polis experienced such large participation in political life like Athens. “There is no shame in being a poor man in Athens” (Brand,n.d, p.33). These incredible words portrait him as the precursor of modern democracy, besides making him one of the main developers of Greek democracy. He actively pushed people to participate in the polis’ life, thus giving their contribution to the improvement of the democratic system.  In this regard, we cannot avoid citing his words: “Our city is called a democracy because it is governed by the many, not the few. In the realm of private disputes, everyone is equal before the law, but when it is a matter of public honours each man is preferred not on the basis of his class but of his good reputation and his merit. (Thucydides, as cited in Miller, n.d.). The strength of Pericles consisted in the ability to motivate the people, showing them the way. In this regard, we can look at him as a great contributor to Athens’s democracy and golden age. However, Pericles was also guilty of  β ις (hybris), thinking that he could bring the war to ὕ ϱPersians. Therefore, the creation of the Delian league showed that Athens did not want allies, but subject poleis. The Greek city-states of the Aegean islands and the Ionian coast were not considered equals, but only subjects (Brand, n.d.). This fact led eventually to the end of democracy in Greece, whose main guilty was Pericles. The Peloponnesian wars, in which Pericles died, defined the decline of Greek democracy. Athens lost the war against Sparta and debunked the role of Athens.Eventually, Pericles, the hero of Athens golden age, was also the symbol of the end of the democracy. We can assure that in this historical figure we can identify but the sunrise and the sunset of an era.However, Athens democracy would have been destined to rise again, giving its eternal contribution to the beginning of the modern western world.
