ANSWER:


The Carthage and Rome in the Punic Wars

Introduction:


At the time of the Punic Wars Carthage and Rome were similarly sized empires, however Carthage was not always as powerful.  According to Jarus (2012), Carthage began as a small colony of Phoenicians located in the area now occupied by Tunisia.  They were strategically located in an important trade route from the East across the Mediterranean Sea.   The Phoenicians who lived in Carthage were great seafarers, due to their strategic location in the meditaranean and their trips overseas to trade their proprietary purple dye, handmade goods, and natural resources such as lumber.  Over time, due to lucrative trade and their talented sailors, the Carthaganians grew one of the greatest navies in the world (factsanddetails.com, n.d.)




Body:

Rome had also grown from a much smaller settlement in a section of land that is now occupied by mainland Italy.  According to Morey (1901), the Roman City-State soon began to conquer neighboring city-states, growing their population and military might in the process.  Soon Rome was encroaching on the neighboring Latium empire.  Rome also had nearby trade partners.  They were able to grow more wealthy and continue to expand into the Italian region, which was inhabited by many independent city-states.  Over time Rome continued to conquer city-states along the Italian peninsula until they encountered the Greek settlement in southern Italy.  Rome continued to overtake most of the Italian mainland once they conquered what was left of Greece.  By now Rome had grown very large, and had developed a great and very efficient army.


Rome had a very strong army, but they soon became aware that they would need a much stronger navy if they were going to be successful in defending themselves from Carthage.  Rome and Carthage came into conflict after Rome came to the defense of small city states near the coast of Sicily when they were attacked by Carthage.  This event began the first Punic war.   Morey (2019) explained, Rome learned very soon after the beginning of the war that their navy was severely disadvantaged against the great Carthigian naval force.  Carthage had greater wealth than Rome, however Rome operated very efficiently.    By the time of the second Punic war, Rome had improvedits navy.  Finally Rome was able to force Carthage to surrender in the Second Punic war due to its superior military and strategy  (Mulligan, 2015, The Second Punic War)




Conclusion:

Although Rome and Carthage came from small beginnings, both of them became great military powers who were nearly matched in size and power.  Rome had a strong and very efficient army, while Carthage had great wealth and the best navy in the world.  In the end, Rome was able to use its superior efficiency and strategy to beat Carthage with its navy.  Finally Rome was able to defeat Carthage causing them to surrender in the second Punic war.
