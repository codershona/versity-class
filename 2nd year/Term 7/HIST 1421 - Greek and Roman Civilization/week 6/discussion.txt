ANSWER:


The Romans in 275 BC started to vanquish different pieces of the Mediterranean and assume responsibility for them. They accepted accountability for Sicily, a little island close to Italy during their battle with the Carthaginians. Since the Greeks feared the Romans, some of them joined the Carthaginians in their fight with the Romans. This made the Romans annoyed with theGreeks, so they left determined to overcome and assume responsibility for Greece. They did this shrewdly (Morey 1901).Before 146 BC, the Romans slyly permitted the Greeks to be free, yet vanquished Corinth a Greek-city-state by 146 BC and assumed responsibility for Greece making them an area of the Roman Empire (Morey 1901).Albeit the Greeks were not content with this, they did well under Roman principle. The Romans managed them for many years, and this made a big deal about the Roman culture and thought fairly Greek in beginning. The Greeks assembled many new houses and structures and exchanged them effectively under the Roman Rule as archaeology has shown that the Greeks fabricated many new houses and structures.Aside from the fruitful exchange and development, the Greeks did under the Roman principle, the Romans likewise scholarly Greek plays as numerous Greeks came to Rome as performers and instructors for the Greeks reasoning was stylish. Then again, a small bunch of Romans went to the incredible universities in Greece, like Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum in Athens. Here they gained from the incomparable Greek logicians.
