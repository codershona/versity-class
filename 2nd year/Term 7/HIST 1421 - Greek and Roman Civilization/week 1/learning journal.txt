Address the question of how Greek democracy ended.

ANSWER:

The Spartans allowed the Athenians to replace the government of the Thirty Tyrants with a new democracy, after their defeat of Athens in 404 BC. The tyranny had been a terrible and bloody failure, and even the Spartans embraced a new form of democracy. (PBS.org n.d.)Democracy as a system of government, quickly spread among other leading city-states, despite the authoritarian grip of Sparta on the Greek world. However, Sparta's dominance failed to last after their battle techniques did not stand the test of time, as such, in 371 BC Spartan hoplites faced their first major defeat in 200 years at the hands of the Theban general Epaminodas. “But Thebes' the dominance of Greece would be short-lived. A new power had begun to assert its leadership over the country: Macedonia. Once a backwater, the Macedonian king Philip II had turned his country into a military powerhouse. Philip's decisive victory came in 338 BC, when he defeated a combined force from Athens and Thebes. A year later Philip formed the League of Corinth which established him as the ruler, or hegemon, of a federal Greece”. According to PBS.org, (n.d.).Democracy in Athens became a thing of the past when the destiny of Greece became inseparable with the new leader of the empire, Philip's son, Alexander the Great.
