Address the question of how Greek democracy ended.

ANSWER:
  
In the beginning, I am going to write about the Spartan which was acknowledged by the Athenians and it could also change the government in Thirty Tyrants within the new democracy. It has been defeated in 404 BC at Athens. The democracy has been formed newly to embrace the Spartans and it also had terrible for the tyranny. In the Greek world from the grip of the Sparta ca be authoritarized by the lead to the city states and make developed for the government system in the democracy. Morevoer, the Sparta failed in their authority in the last battle of those tricks that do not stand to make test in that time. For example, it could be in 371 BC Spartan to face the hoplites and can defeat for initial primary in 200 years ago in the Theban General Epaminodas. The short lived in the Greece needs to be controlled by the Thebes.  The new capacity to start the leadership over the entire country such as Macedonia where the king was Philip II who had turned this country in the direction of military powerhouse. The Athens as well as Thebes can make combination to defeated force form them where the victory came in 338 BC from the Philip's fateful. The federal of the Greece needs to be hegemon for its ruler to make established in the League of Corinth by the Philip. As a result, the democracy of the Athens can be a concept for the past of the destiny for the Greece. Thus, the Philip's son Alexander was the Great for his new leadership in the empire.
