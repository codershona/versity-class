ANSWER:


Poleis in Archaic and Classical-time Greece were city states, which each conducted themselves as a separate nation. They varied in size because of their population, and the area that they controlled. They also had different political leanings, as some were Oligarchies (Sparta), Democratic (Athens) and Tyrannies (Macedon). There were over 1,000 city states in ancient Greece but the most famous of these were obviously Sparta and Athens.  Some of the biggest together with Sparta and Athens were Corinth, Thebes, Syracuse, Rhodes, Argos, Aegina, Eretria and Elis.Each polis was a nation, with unique laws and customs. They had their own tongues, cultures andpersonalities. Where these poleis were similar was in their religion as they worshipped the same set of gods. They also periodically entered into wars (such as the Second Messenian War, Sparta, 685-668 BCE), and alliances (490 BCE Battle of Marathon, Athens and Sparta) These wars and alliances served to spread their ideas and customs over a wider area and also enabled them to be influenced by their allies and enemies.These poleis were similar in that they were city states but were mostly different in that they were most often ruled by different forms of government. For example, Sparta with two king, two councils and an assembly, was an oligarchy (rule of many by a few), Syracuse under Dionysios in 405BCE a Tyranny (rule of many by one illegally), Macedon, under Philip and then Alexanderwas a Monarchy (many by one) and Sparta was a democracy (rule of the majority). The most famous examples of these are democracies and monarchies.In short, the poleis enabled Archaic and Classical-era Greece to grow heights of its power and fame and then its eventual downfall as the governmental systems that it enabled collapsed.
