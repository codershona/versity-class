ANSWER:


Discuss one circumstance that led to the end of the Athenian Golden Age.

Solution

The Golden Age, which began in 449 B.C  and lasted 431 B.C, was the time where Greek city-stateswere at a relatively peace between the Persian and Peloponnesian wars with Athens and Spartabeing the most powerful city-states in Greece. However, Athens was the city which enjoyed theGolden age most due to being the leader of the Delian League.  Athens was the strongest, rich andpromoted democracy in other member states. Athens worked hard and managed to decrease thethreat of Persia and made other city-states free from the Persian control (Butler, 2007). One reason which caused the decline of the golden age and the fall of Athens was that Athensbecame aggressive over other city-states in the Delian league and was forcing members who wantedto step out of the League to be in the league through attacking them. This caused Sparta to form acollision with other city-states known as the Peloponnesian League. This league was formed to fightagainst Athens. The formation of the Peloponnesian League caused the Peloponnesian war whichlasted for almost 30 years thus between 431 BCE and 404 BCE (Brand, n.d.). In the Peloponnesianwar Sparta and its allies managed to defeat Athens and killed Pericles. The defeat marked the end ofthe Golden Age.
