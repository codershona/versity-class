ANSWER:


Explain how successful the Delian League was.


The Delian League was a league of Greek-city states and was led by Athens. The Delian league wasan alliance, made between Athens  and  other states  whose aim was  to  defend themselves  fromPersians, in 478 BCE (Butler, 2007).  After the defeat of Persian Empire, Greek city-states decidedto contribute towards the construction and maintenance of a navy ship in Athens since the Athenianshard a strong navy army and hard enough resources. The member states were given equal chance tovote in the council and their contributions were initially determined by Athens. All this was donebecause the Greek city-sates were worried of future possible attacks by the Persians. The Delian League was formed to liberate eastern Greek cities from Persian rule, and as a defenceto possible revenge from Persians, following the defeat of the Persians at Marathon, Salamis, andPlataea (Butler, 2007).  As a success, the Dalian League managed to get military victories at Ionia,the Thracian Chersonese, and at the Battle of Eurymedon in 466BCE.   All these successes wereagainst Persian forces and this brought peace in the region. In addition, the Delian League had alsoan economic success which saw Athens managing to introduce a common coinage, known as the Athenian silver tetra drachm. Furthermore, the Dalian League promoted democracy throughout theLeague members. Lastly,  the Delian League fostered the establishment of the Athenian Empire due to the influence ofAthens and its power over the other small poleis that joined the Delian League.
