After reading the article on GMO Crops on the African Continent, I would choose to go FOR GMO in Africa.

Q. 1. List the reasons why and how GMO would benefit the African continent.

The following are ways GMO would be beneficial to the Africa continent:

Help solve the problem of hunger and food insecurity.

Beneficial in providing job opportunities and a huge capital for farmers.

Provide greater opportunity to gain support from some developed countries.




Q. Help solve the problem of hunger and poverty.

Genetically modified organisms (GMO) could possibly be helpful in solving the povertyand hunger problem because as the population of Africa continues to grow, the demandfor human wants increases. However, when food becomes extremely difficult to harvestand find, the prices for these commodities also increases. This is where GMOs comes intoplace and this can be achieved by an increase in agricultural activity. There are numerousbenefits   with regards   to   this   and   they   include   the   fact   that   GMOs   are  geneticallyengineered   to grow   crop   yields,   lower   costs   for   the  production  of   food,   reduce   therequirement for pesticides, improve nutrient composition and food quality, fight pests anddisease and intensify food security. GMO’s are able to withstand environmental stressorsthrough the help of technological advancement, thereby providing the right environmentfor  crops  to   grow  in  conditions where  they  might   have  found  it   difficult  to  flourish.



Q. Beneficial in providing job opportunities and a huge capital for farmers.

Without a doubt, GMO crops have the likely possibility to play a major role in climatechange adaptation. In fact, Africa’s farming system relies completely on rain and with theclimate deteriorating, the condition would be unfavourable for farmers because they willeventually lose their jobs or rather earn little to nothing as a result of low crop yield thatstands as a hindrance for them to reach their quota. (Deressa et al., 2014) founds out thataccording to the statistics of the World Bank, 96 percent of African agriculture dependsheavily on  rainfall’s climate. However, due to climate  change, Africa is faced with ashortage of rainfall. Additionally, Africa is mainly faced with warmer climates whichincreases the breeding of insect pests and diseases, hence, it reduces crop productivity.For example, there was a case whereby the farmers in Australia experienced a droughtthat was devouring their crops and they were left being pestered by mice which theyfought   back.   Thus,   the   mice   attacked   their   belongings   and   infested   their   farmlands,destroying crops. Meanwhile, these caused a lot of setbacks for farmers due to their great loss.


Q. Provide greater opportunity to gain support from some developed countries.

This could be seen as an expensive kind of technology to invest in. Regardless, certaindeveloped countries and Non-Governmental Organizations assist in building these kindsof projects. Moreover, leaders from the World Economic Forum can deliberate strategiesand support African nations that require assistance. In this case, local farmers in Africacould start capitalizing on seeds, infrastructure, and new technology that would improve their productivity and profit. For example, in 2016, Bill Gates recommended the creationof an agricultural revolution in Africa. Hence, this technology can also prevent farmers fromexperiencing greater loss because of pests and insects.


Q. 2. Explain how the possible negative impacts of GMO, could be turned into a positive (if any).

For the most part, there are still locals that would rather prefer the more natural way offarming, while on the contrary, the literate ones would prefer to settle for the GMOs becausethey are confident that it would be more productive and lucrative. Obviously, the positiveimpacts   of   GMOs   outweigh   the   negative   impacts.   This   has   brought   about   so   manycontroversies in different African countries because the continent has been austere with itsregulation on genetically modified agriculture.Some of the reasons of which the possible negative impacts of GMOs, could be turned into apositive include that farmers and consumers have to be educated about GMOs because thiscould prevent the doubt about the negative impacts of the GMO only if they have knowledgeof its usefulness. Moreover, this may perhaps be the best way to influence the communitiesand help fight hunger, poverty and unemployment. In addition, some other positive impactssuch as increased crop yields, reduced costs for food or drug production, reduced want forpesticides, improved nutrient composition and food quality, resistance to pests and disease,better food security, and medical aids to the growing population globally.


For example, the United States Department of Energy (2007, as cited in Phillips, 2008) findsthat salmon have been engineered to grow larger and mature faster as a result of the impact ofthe GMOs.Another example is an assessment displaying that a strain of genetically changed soybean conveyed lower levels of phytoestrogen compounds, recognized against coronary disease andharm than ordinary soybeans.


Q. Describe one country in Africa that you think would most benefit from harvesting GMO products.


The one country in Africa that I think would most benefit from harvesting GMO products isNigeria because of its extremely large population. Popularly known as the largest country inAfrica, the country is organized on the western coast of Africa. Moreover, a country withsuch a gigantic population wouldn’t survive completely relying on climate change. Hence,there is the great difficulty of developing harvest without the usage of biotechnologies. Sadly,the people that fearlessly went into Agriculture are been faced with challenges of Climateinadaptability of their harvests and the attacks of bugs and mice. Thus, starvation has becomewidespread in the country. Onyeji (2018) argues that GMO foods or products are very safe even though scrutinized bymany. For example, in northern Nigerian there are places with just three months of rain, theyare like a desert. So, to plant maize in a place like Maiduguri which happens to be in theNorth, a farmer will pick that gene in sorghum liable for making it withstand draught theninsert it in the maize. Afterwards, the new gene will be recognized in the maize which willeventually express itself. Also, GMOs in Nigeria improves the farming system. GMO seedsare also currently given to farmers.  Cerier (2017) explains that GMO technology embracesgreat benefits and potential for Africa, which is required to increase food output and to feed a rising   population.  However,   without   a   severe  extension   in   food   creation,  Africa  faces   afortune of extended absence of quality food and reliance on food imports to deal with feedingits people.
