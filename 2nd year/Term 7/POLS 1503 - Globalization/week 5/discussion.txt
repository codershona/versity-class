ANSWER:

Globalization101 (n.d.) defines development as "the urge to enhance the lives of citizens in poor countries in terms of monetary necessities, welfare, sustenance, education, and a clean environment as defined by the world community" (p. 2). “Geography, high economic poverty, hunger, high mortality rates, unsafe water supplies, bad education systems, corrupt governments, war, and poor sanitation” are just a few of today's development issues (Globalization101, n.d., p. 5). Development necessitates workforce diversity, which is difficult in low-population countries. Access to global markets is also challenging for countries without ports. High economic poverty has a variety of effects on development, one of which is that kids that are in poverty, are more likely to drop out of school, resulting in more unskilled employees or limiting their employment opportunities. Hunger also makes people less productive, both intellectually and physically. A bad educational system produces graduates who are unable to meet the demands of progress, hence limiting growth. People flee their country as a result of war, resulting in some type of brain drain, or it may limit the chances available. Poverty reduction, effective governance, sustainable development, gender equality, and new investment techniques are just a few of the ways for addressing current development issues (Globalization101, n.d., p. 13 - 18). Job development, particularly in manufacturing, can help to alleviate poverty by increasing the country's export revenue. Developing countries trade with wealthy countries instead of getting aid from them, as part of the Trade-Not-Aid approach. Poverty reduction can be achieved by creating jobs, particularly in manufacturing, which generates revenue for the country through exports. Developing countries trade with industrialized countries rather than accepting aid from them as part of the Trade-Not-Aid approach. This would give them the ability to be self-sufficient and earn additional revenue through exporting. The goal of a good governance plan is to prevent or reduce corruption, ensuring that help supplied to countries is used effectively. The goal of a sustainable development strategy is to promote development in ways that do not harm the environment, so that future generations will not inherit a damaged environment. Women's empowerment programs, whether through business financing or education, are part of the gender equality approach. A new investing approach is providing loans to poor people to assist them in starting a business and so providing for their family.
