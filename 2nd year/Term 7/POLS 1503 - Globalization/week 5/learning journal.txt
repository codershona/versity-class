ANSWER:

How do you feel about the feedback you have received from your peers?

Now I am going to talk about the feeling about the feedback I receive from my peers. It is really a great way to learn a lot of new things while receiving feedback from peers and it is another challenging factor. Although it plays an important role in our learning strategy as well as I had been educated myself by following these feedbacks. In my mind I think it is a kind of experience which has a point of views on my submissions and my peer can also share their own knowledge with me and logics which is really great way that assist me to understand it a great deal. For instance, in my last discussion posts unit 4 I was asked to clarifying various ways to improve my present issues of development. 

The basic feedback I received from a peer later carefully reviewing my posts I agreed with all my points along with after that and my peer asked me whether I am covering any problems from the country I am from including all was right that we were facing it next I realize another feedback from one of the points that I had been mentioned in my discussion posts in regard to government watching of corruption along with the student respond by saying while the corruption was taking care off. This might be continued difficulty decreased. This feedback allowed me a spark and got me thinking and reasoning myself yes it was true as well as this makes me develop my reading also. As a result, accepting those feedbacks were another challenging for me.   

How do you think your peers feel about the feedback you provided to them?

I'm not sure, but I'm sure  most of the students are happy and can learn from the feedback I gave them. First and foremost, you need to get the job done quickly. Understand the content, carefully read the content posted by the students, and try to bring something unique to the discussion. And  most importantly, most students are confident that my feedback will help.
