Learning Journal Unit 6
Protecting Culture

In this week’s readings, you learned about how culture is preserved—such as through language and value systems. Now, it is your turn to reveal how your culture is being kept alive in your country. How do you rightfully preserve your cultural identity, through food, traditions, language, values, or perhaps in some other aspect?

Furthermore, take a moment to reflect and express how cultural traditions have changed in your region, due to globalization. You can compare yourself to your parents’ or even grandparents’ generation.

The journal entry should be about a page in length.  If applicable, be sure to cite any resources you use to support your learning journal. 

ANSWER:

Primarily, from this week's reading, we learned something about culture and the different ways it is preserved. Speaking of how culture is nurtured here. Nigeria is a multicultural us of a of various ethnicities, however the most important ruling agencies are Ivos with within the east, Yoruba with within the west, and Hausa furbe with within the north. There are also many other ethnic minorities, including the Tiv, Ulhobo, and  Eric. The country was able to maintain different cultures through various means such as language, art, tradition, food and values.

I am very acquainted with the lifestyle of the Japanese a part of Nigeria, particularly here. Igbos hold their lifestyle in a number of ways, inclusive of the usage of language for communication. Also, it's miles very clean to differentiate Igbos from different ethnic groups. The paintings generally seen at gala's much like the brand new Yams fest, this is held annually, is that with inside the festival, men placed on red hats, placed on what they need spherical their necks, tie envelopes spherical their waists, and with walking sticks. I virtually have my fingers crossed. Meanwhile, the lady ties  wraps round her waist, some beads of various colorings round her neck, a big bead on her waist, and a pinnacle with small beads on her legs.

I also think that traditional wart weddings are one of the most important ways  to show off your culture. Igbos are inherently very kind. They treat and respect visitors with friendly gestures.

In general, Nigeria as a country protects heritage by sponsoring and hosting cultural events that promote and celebrate divers' heritage, such as the National Cultural Festival, which displays almost  the entire cultural heritage of each ethnic group in the country. I am. From cultural dance, creative art (sculpture, drawing, weaving, bookbinding, molding), and  the founding of the National Museum of Tourism and Culture.


If you compare our current generation to the generations of my parents and grandparents, I think there is a huge difference. The culture, especially the Igbo culture, is really derogatory. Today's generation pays less attention to cultural norms and values. I prefer white weddings to traditional weddings. English is currently the main means of communication, and few people speak their native language. Rather, they have a party and go out.
