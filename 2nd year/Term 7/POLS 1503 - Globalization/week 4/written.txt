Globalization POL 1503  

University of The People


Emerging technology is virtually taking over the labor market by an increased margin. The  specificity of the technology depends on the type of job one engages in.  Robotics and artificial  intelligence, in my opinion, have the propensity of taking over most of the jobs. This  technology is undoubtedly diminishing the available jobs carried out by humans by a great  margin thus scaling down the employment rate in most industries. Some of the main industries  that would be affected by the impacts of robotic and artificial intelligence would include health  care, transport, logistics, customer services, and home maintenance. These two emerging  technologies share certain trusts and concerns approximately about the impact of innovation on  work. For example, many are concerned that our existing social structures—and particularly our  educational institutions—are not satisfactorily planning individuals for the aptitudes that will be  required within the job advertise of the long haul. Alternately, others have trust that the coming  changes will be an opportunity to reassess our society’s relationship to work itself—by  returning to a center on small-scale or artisanal modes of generation, or by giving individuals  more time to spend on recreation, self-improvement, or time with cherished ones(Smith &  Anderson, 2014). Robots and artificial intelligence would certainly dominate a wide variety of  our jobs as self-driving cars, intelligent digital agents that are impactful had already displaced a  lot of jobs than those created. This is quite evident of the fact that with time most of these jobs  will be performed by these two emerging technologies but that being so most jobs uniquely  require human characteristics such as empathy, creativity, judgment, or critical thinking, and  these domains would never be dominated by automation.  The technology I would choose in my opinion that has the lowest potential of taking over  people’s jobs would be unmanned and autonomous vehicles. They are used in real estate,  farming, amusement, and natural life administration. Individuals utilize them to photograph the  property, screen bothers pervasions in crops, and oversee natural life sanctuaries. This helps   authorities get too hard-to-reach ranges and track issues independently without people having to  be in specific geographic spots (West, 2015). Despite the growing presence of this emerging technology, it is still that we have more vehicles control by humans than this form of  technology. For instance, the drone is unmanned and could be used by law enforcement to  disperse crowds but still, we need more physical human effort to do those jobs. The presence of  this emerging technology had not in any way eradicated the use of vehicles run by humans such  as buses, taxis as well as train operators. This also means the presence of such a technology  would not affect the jobs of those operating the aforementioned vehicles. So the reality still  remains that even if unmanned/autonomous vehicles navigate the roads without human  intervention, they still can’t fully take over the position of drivers ( Llanasas, 2020). There is a  whole lot of work that can be done by only humans to enable these vehicles to function  efficiently such as repairing the vehicle, checking up, loading and securing cargo  and so on.   The rapid increase of these technologies from robotics, artificial intelligence, computerized  algorithms, mobile sensors, 3-D printing to unmanned/autonomous vehicles had a substantial  impact on the workforce. It has made most jobs easier to and at the same time they save a lot of  time compared to the human effort which at some point needs sufficient monitoring and  evaluation of activities and tasks that are supposed to be carried out. Electronic devices such as  computers are classical examples of this as well as the internet makes it quite possible for the  entire globe to be connected within a short period of time. This is done by the use of  computerized algorithms to make all the communications viable from one person to another.  The positive impacts of these emerging technologies cannot be overemphasized. The negative  side of the coin would certainly be taking the vast section of the jobs that could have been  performed by humans. This means tasks associated with thinking, multitasking, and fine motor  skills would be underperformed by humans in the long run.  In conclusion, all these technologies play a crucial part in our lives and they contribute  immensely to the smooth running of our tasks making it quite simple for us to complete  assigned roles. In the list robots and artificial intelligence are most likely to take the lead in  taking the vast number of human jobs in most industries but it’s quite evident that some jobs would still be done by humans. By all means, a digital world is worth embracing as it improves  productivity and saves a lot of time that could have cost a lot of resources to finance.
