ANSWER:


In the beginning, I am going to talk about the factors which can build up the inequality. But globalization had great effects to develop inequality while each country can import in budget steal all from the overseas. But the domestic can supply to contract within the diminish of the jobs sector. This could also have a higher ratio of unemployment as well as it can drop the real standards of living. The real wages can put under downward of pressure as well as inequality can also increase and it can leads to higher profits of income for the multinational companies like Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Google. This can translate within the cost effective senior executive that payouts or growing shareholder dividends. Another third direction is if the globalization could able to generate inequality the growing up of competition can be a return to high skilled employment and diminish people expect earnings which could be low-skilled jobs.  

Thus technology can also contribute the risen of the inequality high and middle income of the countries that could be impacts and the reason is blue-collar workers and paid off better to make recover the labor-saving technologies. The employees need to be moved to employment in retail or home or healthcare. This could pay general lower and give everyone the advantages of increased of the productivity and technology could be recovered by the human work. Moreover it could appear technologies which can lead to misplacingmore jobs and it can lead the inequality in many jobs and change only on few jobs to survive. The gaps among the people, which could increase the technologies which could be more efficient and make fast for the humans that can ignore the humans effort. 


On the other words, the globalization can have a great effect Egypt like medications that could available takeover with others too. Most vaccines and antibiotics that were used all over the world to avoid the spread of diseases and fatal infections in some developed countries. Many European trade did agreement such as Mercosur agreement. But without skipping the rising economic growth in the foreign community it could have a free-trade. We can also continue the market natural resources like natural gas or oil or minerals. This would also assist technologies in Egypt to develop because Egyptians and it could produce more goods for the lower cost. There could also export those things in abroad and the popular brand is “OKHTEIN' and so on. As a result we need more improvement in the educational level and make a better environment for students and think goods things in technologies to study for the success.
