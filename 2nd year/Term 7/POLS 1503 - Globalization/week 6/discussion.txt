The life of Samir Musa shows how his parents lived in different cultures and races. His friends, family, where he grew, and the diversity of work and life affect his personal world. However, as a person with a broad vision and rich cultural life experience, when he and his family used to visit relatives where they lived, his life conflict between local culture and globalization caught his attention. Although globalization is spreading across the world and bringing many positive changes and prosperity, destructive wars can still occur on the ground, bringing poverty and suffering. One of the local doctors in Costa Rica was learning more and more how to treat skin leishmaniasis, but because the local science and knowledge only trust Western science and knowledge, his people did not hear his voice. I think Samir Moussa was happy with globalization because he understands different languages, which allows him to speak three languages fluently.Personally, I think globalization has shaped my global culture through thoughts, preferences, and concepts. We try to look fashionable like everyone else in the world. We cook according to recipes from different countries/regions. We celebrate other people’s holidays and traditions. We easily welcome foreign companies to our region. To which I think is the benefit of globalization. Globalization affects global culture in three ways. Most globalization analysts have identified a new category of people who are skilled professionals, well-educated in the corporate world, and have a global culture. This community is called "Davos Culture". They are seen as a driving force for the development of foreign trade, and they pursue a business strategy aimed at promoting globalization.They speak fluent English and travel the world in many different ways (Oliver, 2017).

In addition, they dominate the global economy and are the only country in the world that has fast food chains worldwide. This shows the extent to which the US economic model has affected the world. There are many problems. Due to globalization, one of them is the influence of one political system on another; in addition, the tax laws and labor laws of globalized countries conflict, the trade war between the United States, China, and Europe, and the growth of illegal immigration in Europe.
