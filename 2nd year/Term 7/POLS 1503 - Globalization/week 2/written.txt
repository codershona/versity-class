Project 1:

Name and detailed description of the project.

Benin Youth Inclusion Project This project will start in 2021 and is expected to close in 2025. The project aims to increase the economic and social inclusion of vulnerable youth, and the goal is to strengthen the youth's participation in communities, economically and socially speaking. The project will have national coverage and will be conducted in each commune of the country


Name of the IFI that handled the project.

N/A - Project ID P170425

Type of medal: gold

Positive impacts and how they could have been even more impactful.

In my opinion, this project has multiple benefits long time lasting. We can all agree that education isthe base of civil society. This project will offer to the youth to learn a job that the country needs them to do. It provides an increase of access of vulnerable young adults to social and professional networks and helps them to develop non-cognitive skills through sports, etc. In the end, the project aims at opening a grant window that will provide non-reimbursable start-up funds for individuals and groups for the initial phase of their activities. I believe this project is great, but if we want to make it perfect I would include in the project women that are victims of domestic violence, etc.

Negative impacts and how they could have been avoided.

Especially in backward countries, those kinds of projects could lead to risks of exclusion, and socialconflicts. Thus, to minimize those risks it is necessary to be transparent and be as inclusive as possible.

Project 2:

Name and detailed description of the project.

Health System Improvement Project 

This project has taken place in Albania in 2015 and is closely linked to the third goal of  17goals of sustainable and development goals promoted in 2015. The third goal aims to the GOOD HEALTH AND  WELL-BEING of people around the world and especially in underdeveloped countries.  The Health System Improvement project in Albania aims to contribute to improve the health system and modernize the hospitals,  strengthening performance management, and make the hospitals accessible to all, reducing the costs for the population.

Name of the IFI that handled the project.

MINISTRY OF FINANCE ALBANIA  - Project ID:  P144688

Type of medal: Silver Positive impacts and how they could have been even more impactful.

In my opinion, the first benefit that Albania has seen from such an important project is the fact that the government was pushed to regulate the health sector reforms. This project has contributed to improving the  Hospital service decreasing the out-of-pocket expenses for each individual. The other benefit we can note relates to the health management information system improving communication system and supplied the select hospitals with advanced technology as in other developed countries. I believe, this project could have been more impactful if it would have included hospital structures of smaller cities because people would not have been forced to travel for hours to reach an advanced hospital structure.

Negative impacts and how they could have been avoided.

As I mentioned above,  the project could have involved hospitals in remote areas as well, because asa consequence other hospitals will face complete degradation, and people of remote areas won't have anymore a hospital as their reference point. According to the data, Eurostat 180 Albanian doctors have left the country in  2017 because they could not find a job in decent hospital structures.I believe this is linked to the fact that only a few selected hospitals have been involved in major projects, while others were left out. 


Project 3:

Name and detailed description of the project.

Additional Forest Conservation and Sustainability in the Heart of the colombian Amazon Project This project has begun in 2014 and was expected to close in 2019 but the proposed Additional Financing (AF) has extended the project for an additional three years to 2022 to consolidate project activities initiated the original plan. This project promotes sustainable land use activities in order to reduce deforestation and conserve biodiversity in the Project area. The project seeks to address the conservation of an area of over nine million hectares in the Heart of the Colombian Amazon.

Name of the IFI that handled the project.

N/A - Project ID P158003

Type of medal: Bronze 

Positive impacts and how they could have been even more impactful.

The benefits of this project in Colombia are multiple,  such as the protection of the tropical rainforest. The project area will be effectively protected from deforestation. Thanks to these project activities the effective management across the protected area, at the national and local scale will be improved. In my opinion, something more that could have been done to increase the impact of this project is to raise awareness among people on how to interact with nature and on the importance, forests and nature have on our daily life.

Negative impacts and how they could have been avoided.

I do not see negative impacts on this project, if not the fact that it is not very clear what is the specific plan for the indigenous communities that live in the protected areas. In my opinion, indigenous people are those that better know how to treat nature with respect, but at the same time, they are paying the higher price for the climate change caused by modern society.  Council Leader Jose María Arroyo from the Arhuaco community says that, keep damaging nature will not only affect them but the entire population if we all do not do our part (2017). Hence, I hope this project does not have an impact on the indigenous people.
