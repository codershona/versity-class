Project 1:

Name and detailed description of the project.

In the beginning, Benin Youth Inclusion for this project would be start in 2021 and we also can predict that, it will be close in 2025. This project main goals in the broaden the economic and social involvement of the youth of vulnerable. There aim is to make strongest the youth participation in the communities and socially speaking.

Name of the IFI that handled the project.

N/A - Project ID P170425

Type of medal: gold

Positive impacts and how they could have been even more impactful.

In my point of view, this project needs to have many advantages for long lasting. The base of the education needs the civil society. This project would also propose to learn the youth a job so that country require them. It also gives the risen of the access in the vulnerable young adults to social to assit them build their non-cognitive skills via sports. At last, this project major goals is to open a grant window to provide non-reimbursable to start-up funds and make individual groups in starting phase of the activities. I trust that, this project is better while we need to make it more beter and need to include in the project women so that the victims of domestic violence. 

Negative impacts and how they could have been avoided.

Moreover, in those backward countries this types of projects is risk to leand and there would be many social conflicts and if we want to minimize the risks it is important to transparent and make it possible to inclusive. 

Project 2:

Name and detailed description of the project.

Health System Improvement Project 

This project has taken place in Albania in 2015 and is closely linked to the third goal of  17goals of sustainable and development goals promoted in 2015. The third goal aims to the GOOD HEALTH AND  WELL-BEING of people around the world and especially in underdeveloped countries.  The Health System Improvement project in Albania aims to contribute to improve the health system and modernize the hospitals,  strengthening performance management, and make the hospitals accessible to all, reducing the costs for the population.

Name of the IFI that handled the project.

MINISTRY OF FINANCE ALBANIA  - Project ID:  P144688

Type of medal: Silver Positive impacts and how they could have been even more impactful.

In my opinion, the first benefit that Albania has seen from such an important project is the fact that the government was pushed to regulate the health sector reforms. This project has contributed to improving the  Hospital service decreasing the out-of-pocket expenses for each individual. The other benefit we can note relates to the health management information system improving communication system and supplied the select hospitals with advanced technology as in other developed countries. I believe, this project could have been more impactful if it would have included hospital structures of smaller cities because people would not have been forced to travel for hours to reach an advanced hospital structure.

Negative impacts and how they could have been avoided.

As I mentioned above,  the project could have involved hospitals in remote areas as well, because asa consequence other hospitals will face complete degradation, and people of remote areas won't have anymore a hospital as their reference point. According to the data, Eurostat 180 Albanian doctors have left the country in  2017 because they could not find a job in decent hospital structures.I believe this is linked to the fact that only a few selected hospitals have been involved in major projects, while others were left out. 


Project 3:

Name and detailed description of the project.

Additional Forest Conservation and Sustainability in the Heart of the colombian Amazon Project This project has begun in 2014 and was expected to close in 2019 but the proposed Additional Financing (AF) has extended the project for an additional three years to 2022 to consolidate project activities initiated the original plan. This project promotes sustainable land use activities in order to reduce deforestation and conserve biodiversity in the Project area. The project seeks to address the conservation of an area of over nine million hectares in the Heart of the Colombian Amazon.

Name of the IFI that handled the project.

N/A - Project ID P158003

Type of medal: Bronze 

Positive impacts and how they could have been even more impactful.

The benefits of this project in Colombia are multiple,  such as the protection of the tropical rainforest. The project area will be effectively protected from deforestation. Thanks to these project activities the effective management across the protected area, at the national and local scale will be improved. In my opinion, something more that could have been done to increase the impact of this project is to raise awareness among people on how to interact with nature and on the importance, forests and nature have on our daily life.

Negative impacts and how they could have been avoided.

I do not see negative impacts on this project, if not the fact that it is not very clear what is the specific plan for the indigenous communities that live in the protected areas. In my opinion, indigenous people are those that better know how to treat nature with respect, but at the same time, they are paying the higher price for the climate change caused by modern society.  Council Leader Jose María Arroyo from the Arhuaco community says that, keep damaging nature will not only affect them but the entire population if we all do not do our part (2017). Hence, I hope this project does not have an impact on the indigenous people.
