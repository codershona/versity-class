In the beginning, Benin Youth Inclusion for this project would be start in 2021 and we also can predict that, it will be close in 2025. This project main goals in the broaden the economic and social involvement of the youth of vulnerable. There aim is to make strongest the youth participation in the communities and socially speaking.

N/A - Project ID P170425

Type of medal: gold

Positive impacts and how they could have been even more impactful.

In my point of view, this project needs to have many advantages for long lasting. The base of the education needs the civil society. This project would also propose to learn the youth a job so that country require them. It also gives the risen of the access in the vulnerable young adults to social to assit them build their non-cognitive skills via sports. At last, this project major goals is to open a grant window to provide non-reimbursable to start-up funds and make individual groups in starting phase of the activities. I trust that, this project is better while we need to make it more beter and need to include in the project women so that the victims of domestic violence. 

Negative impacts and how they could have been avoided.

Project 2:

Name and detailed description of the project.

Health System Improvement Project 

In my seocnd point of the view, this project has been apropriated by the place in Albania in 2015 as well a it was also closely combined with third goal of 17 goals of the sustainable as well as the development aim to promoted in 2015. The tertian aim is to make people around the world good health and well being in underdeveloped countries. The health system can be improved and modernize the hospitals in this project in Albania and make contribution to make strong the performance management and build accessible to all hospitals and make reduces of the costs for the people. 

Name of the IFI that handled the project.

MINISTRY OF FINANCE ALBANIA  - Project ID:  P144688

Type of medal: Silver Positive impacts and how they could have been even more impactful.

In my opinion, the first benefit that Albania has seen from such an important project is the fact that the government was pushed to regulate the health sector reforms. This project has contributed to improving the  Hospital service decreasing the out-of-pocket expenses for each individual. The other benefit we can note relates to the health management information system improving communication system and supplied the select hospitals with advanced technology as in other developed countries. I believe, this project could have been more impactful if it would have included hospital structures of smaller cities because people would not have been forced to travel for hours to reach an advanced hospital structure.

Negative impacts and how they could have been avoided.

As I mentioned above, the project could have involved hospitals in remote areas as well, because asa consequence other hospitals will face complete degradation, and people of remote areas won't have anymore a hospital as their reference point. According to the data, Eurostat 180 Albanian doctors have left the country in  2017 because they could not find a job in decent hospital structures.I believe this is linked to the fact that only a few selected hospitals have been involved in major projects, while others were left out. 


Project 3:

In my third point of the view, The forest of the conservation and Sustainability in the heart of the colombian amazon project needs to start in 2014 and we can also hope that it would be close in 2019 and offers to AF and make extension for the project and the more three years to 2022 to consolidate the project activities and start the pattern of the schme.

Positive impacts and how they could have been even more impactful.

The main advantages for this project is in Colombia which has variety like the security of the tropical rain forest. Moreover, the area can be effective to make secure from the deforestation. We are thankfully create the project activities and make the effective management and secure the area. In the national and local scale needs to be developed. In my point of view, this project needs to be make more interesting and increase interest among the people and make raises of the awareness. 


Negative impacts and how they could have been avoided.

In my own opinion I am not agree that if there are negative impacys on this project the main facst will not be that much clear and without having specific plan it will not protect the areas and communities. Furthermore, domestic people are good and know how to reat the nature with honor in sync. They also need to pay huge amount of money for the climate changes occurs by modern society. The damages needs to be kept in the nature which would not affetc them and the whole population will be not part of it said by Council Leader Jose Maria Arroyo from Arroyo Community. Now we can only wish that thisproject does not impact on the domestion citizens.
