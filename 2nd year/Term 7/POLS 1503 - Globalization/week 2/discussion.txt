ANSWER:
The 8 Millenium Development Goals are global midterm ambitions that came about in September 2000 when leaders of 189 countries gathered at the United Nations headquarters and signed the Millennium Declaration. The goals were set to be achieved in 2015. I believe the goals were quite relevant at that point and they still generally are, to date;  

Goal 1 

Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; there is still a lot of poverty and hunger in the world today. 

Goal 2 

Achieve universal primary education; this is still very relevant because quite a number of countries in the world are still not able to have access to proper basic education. 


Goal 3 

Promote gender equality and empower women; this is a topic that has been a point of debate and discussion, over time. It is an issue that, if solved, would make the world better. 

Goal 4 

Reduce child mortality; even though the child mortality rate in the world has dropped by a large extent from 93 deaths out of 1,000 births to 38 deaths in 1,000 as at 2019, it is still an issue that is relevant in the world. 

Goal 5

Improve maternal health; poor maternal health is one of the factors that cause child mortality from childbirth so I still think it is very relevant. 

Goal 6 

Combating HIV/AIDs, malaria, and other diseases; is also still quite relevant due to the negative effects these diseases still have in the world. 

Goal 7 

Ensure environmental sustainability; environmental sustainability is a very important goal that I think, would always be relevant. 

Goal 8 

Develop a global partnership for development; Partnerships are very necessary in order for the other goals to be achieved.  


I believe that the Sustainable Development Goals are more relevant and much more realistic, especially with where the world is, currently.
