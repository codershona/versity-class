ANSWER:


Globalisation in simplest terms refers to sharing of culture, money and products between countries, driven by international trade, investment and supported by information technology (Brown,n.d.). This learning journal discusses globalization  based on the case study of Liberian Plantation Workers Allege Poor Condition.Globalization change some people lives through Increased job opportunities as evidenced by job opportunities created by firestone tire company in Liberia, as over 6,000 people were employed (Auguston et al.,2014). This helped to ease the high unemployment rate of Liberia. However, Globalization on the hand also fuels conflict if not carefully managed. The conflict emerges for many reasons that include cultural differences, harsh treatment to locals and exploitation of environmental. In Liberia for example workers lodged the complaint over poor working conditions and child labour.The issues went to court and the court verdict favoured the fire stone company and this was not satisfactory to the victims. Normally locals have no capacity to hire lawyers as such effortto seek justice is always compromised. Despite the fact that workers presented their case on anumber of issues that include hiring of under aged children and contamination of water bodies through uncareful waste disposal, but the company claimed all these claims are baseless and cited that the company provides education and healthcare services to employees and their immediate family members hence the court ruled in favour of them.To end similar conflicts from occurring in the future, there is a need to put in place well stipulated labour laws, that will categorically prohibit child labour and improve condition of the workers including occupation safety and provision of health insurance to workers. Furthermore, each company should carry out environment impact assessment before rolling out their operation and government should introduce pay as you pollute policy to discourage companies from degrading the environment.Over the past years Africa my region continues to register mushrooming of foreign companies and increased adoption of foreign culture as a result of globalisation. Globalisation has provided a lot of opportunities and challenges and among them include cheap prices of products and services, increased conflicts between locals and foreign traders due to competition of securing trade positions and working conditions. Besides African culture is slowly being swallowed by western culture.
