Learning Journal Unit 7
Choose one of the main water systems you have learned about that is also in your country (do you have a lake, river, coast, or coral reefs in your country?).
Rivers and lakes
Coastal areas
Deep sea/Oceans
Coral reefs
Research that item in our Textbook, and look online to study the environmental issues associated with it in your nation. Then list what you consider to be the two (2) main environmental problems associated with it. Please do not forget to list the references you used.

In what ways do these issues affect you and your family directly?

In your own words, please describe one way you think those problems could perhaps be reduced or alleviated?

Please outline in your own words, one other new thing you learned this week in the course. How does it apply to your life?


ANSWER:

Question 1

Rivers and lakes are the most important water systems in Nigeria. Nigeria has two significant rivers: The Niger and the Benue ( Ita, 1994). Several other tributary rivers, however, flow into the Niger-Benue valley and Lake Chad. The drainage pattern of the entire country is formed by the basins of these major rivers and their tributaries ( Ita, 1994). Other water systems found in the country include floodplains, mining, and stagnant pools.

Question 2 

The main challenges are:1. Oil exploration firms' improper discharge of harmful substances and oil spills in water bodies are destroying the mangrove forest, as well as fish, shellfish, and ecosystems (Krause, 2015). It is a severe threatening environmental concern particularly in the country's south-west region, that has invariably impacted the livelihood of the people in the country/region, as they are primarily fishermen and farmers, and it has impacted people, the environment, and the economy in general (Krause, 2015).2. The indiscriminate disposal of municipal solid trash is becoming more prevalent. It is connected to poverty, bad governance, urbanization, population increase, low living standards, and a lack of environmental awareness and management of environmental knowledge waste (Abila & Kantola, 2019). Most of these wastes come from residential sources and are typical of household garbage (Abila & Kantola, 2019).

Question 3

There is no direct impact on my family and myself because we do not reside in these riverine locations. However, there is an indirect influence. Most of the food consumed is grown in that region of the country, and as a result, the cost of purchasing agricultural products has increased significantly.

Question 4

One of the most effective ways to address these issues is to raise public awareness about the impact of water-related issues on the environment. Municipal solid waste management is an integral part of urban infrastructure that ensures environmental and human health protection (Abila & Kantola, 2019).In addition, the government must ensure that suitable trash disposal systems are in place and the application of practical techniques or technologies. Enforcing sanitation and thorough compliance to guarantee that all regulations are fully adhered to is another excellent technique to address the issues.Question 5Water scarcity and water quality are two essential ideas that I learned. I also realized how important both of them are in our lives and how their value fluctuates depending on various factors, such as population, in different parts of the world (UNDESA, 2014).
