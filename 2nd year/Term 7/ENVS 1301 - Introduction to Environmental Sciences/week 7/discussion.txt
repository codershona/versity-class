This week we are going to look at the topic of water quality vs. water quantity. Make sure your post is in your OWN words. Don’t copy from sources you use for information.

Please list two bits of information, statistics or facts that you found at some of these links which interested and/or surprised you?

Explain, in your own words, what the difference is between water quality and water quantity?

Is water quantity or quality the biggest issue in your local village/town/city? Why? Explain.

Are there disputes, violence or wars over water in your local village/town/city?

Look up what IWRM is: define it.*

Would IWRM work to help water issues in your local village/town/city?

ANSWER:



Question 1

1. Approximately 1.2 billion people, or roughly one-fifth of the world's population, live in locations wherephysical water scarcity exists, with 500 million more facing this predicament shortly. An additional 1.6 billion people, or roughly a quarter of the world's population, are affected by economic water scarcity, implying that governments in those areas lack adequate infrastructure for obtaining water from rivers and other sources (UNDESA, 2014).

2. According to the Global Environment Outlook study from 2000, one out of every five people does not have safe/clean water to drink. Fifteen million newborns and toddlers die each year due to contaminatedwater (UNEP, n.d). 2 million tons of sewage and other liquid waste are discharged into the world's seas every day. Every year, unsafe water kills more people than other forms of violence combined, including war, earthquakes, and other natural disasters (UNEP, n.d).


Question 2

Water quantity is the computation and production sum of water from one or more land byways, computed by the final amount and highest movement over a set timetable. Water quality refers to the safety and purity of water supplies for all living things.

Question 3

In recent times, water shortage has been one of the most pressing issues confronting many societies andthe world. Water demand has climbed at a rate more than twice that of population growth in the last century. While there is no worldwide water scarcity, an increasing number of regions are experiencing chronic water shortages (UNDESA, 2014). Such is also the case in various parts of Nigeria. Due to the climate change component of desertification, there are increasing water crises, particularly in the country's northern section. Water pollution, such as using hazardous chemicals and fertilizers, decreases the freshwater available for human and animal use. Population growth has raised the demand for freshwater, resulting in increased competition for water among humans, animals, agriculture, and industry for various services and purposes, resulting in water scarcity.




Question 4

Due to deserts and droughts, the volume of freshwater available to sustain animal husbandry is the principal occupation of many Northern Nigerians. This has resulted in a North-South movement, which has exacerbated tensions and conflict between cattle-raising Fulanis and farmers in Nigeria's southern region. As a result, Nigeria has seen escalating war and deadly terrorism for nearly a decade, making it one of the world's most violent regions.


Question 5

Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) is a process that fosters the proper management and development of land, water, and related resources to maximize financial and social well-being sustainably for ecosystems and the environment. IWRM is a concept that promotes development partnership and oversight of social neutrality, economic proficiency, and ecological sustainability of all viable eco-resources with no negative influence or limitations to ecosystem harmonization and long-term endurance (UNDESA, 2014).The many varied uses of finite water resources are interdependent, which is the basis of IWRM. High irrigation needs and contaminated drainage flows from agriculture, imply that there is less fresh water available for industrial use and drinking (UNEP, n.d). In contrast, contaminated municipal and industrial wastewater pollutes rivers and threatens ecosystems (UNEP, n.d).



Question 6. 

Despite its efforts, Nigeria has been unable to manage its water resources sustainably in most sections ofthe country. As a result, given the rapidly worsening urban water crises in both industrialized and developing countries, smart water management is critical. So, IWRM is the best alternative for the government to assist individuals with water difficulties.
