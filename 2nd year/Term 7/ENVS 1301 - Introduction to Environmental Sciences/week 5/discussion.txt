Your posts should cover the questions below in full, and be at least 300 words long. Then reply to and peer-review at least three other posts by next Wednesday 11:59PM UoPeople Time, and rate the posts and replies.

This week, please look online and read the week’s learning guide and the textbook chapters. Then, research different forms of alternative (renewable) energy forms available.

Choose two, and then answer the following questions:

What does the term “renewable” mean?

Which two renewable energy forms did you choose?

For each, describe two benefits.

For each, describe two drawbacks.

Which of these you feel would best serve your community? Why? Explain.

According to The WWF Energy Report prepared by WWF and Ecofys, “by 2050, we could get all the energy we need from renewable sources.” What is your response to this statement?

ANSWER:

In the beginning, I am going to talk about the terms of renewable which is known as assets which might be used constantly after being renewed. The sources of renewable of energies such as wind power either hydropower which does not cause air pollutants conversely dischagre along with limitless on the point of they were naturally restored. 

The two forms of energy I have chosen are hydro and wind.

Benefits:

Both hydropower and wind power they provide clean source of energy as there no emissions released into the air. Hydropower stations can provide flood control and become a source of recreation activities fishing. It can also provide clean water to neighboring communities that can be used for farming or domestic activities.Wind power is cost-effective because there are no fuel costs associated with its production. Thereis an economical use of land where wind turbines are installed. The land beneath can be used for other activities like farming. 

Moreover, hydropower plants provide flood try to protection and could be a source of recreational fishing. You can also provide nearby communities with clean water  that can be used for agriculture and household chores. Wind power is cheap because there is no fuel cost associated with its production. Space is used sparingly wherever wind turbines are installed. The land below can be used for other activities such as agriculture.

Drawbacks:

Hydro water: 

By adjustment in water temperature can involve in species for example, fish along with other plants which lives in the water. At the same time, water is used to the reservoir, the migration of fish is affected. Turbine operation can reduce, kill, or injure fish and other species.

Wind power:

Wind is wind-dependent, so the amount of energy you spend each day can vary by depending on how fast or easy the wind blows. Wind turbines are resounding. Therefore, it can cause noise pollution and affect people and animals in the environment.


Wind power has the potential to be most useful to my community as it is inexpensive and does not require a lot of space to operate. It gives a cleanse energy source.

The renewable energy production and sustainability are a joint effort. While we all get together and accept the ECO FYS recommendations, we can move on  to the use of 100% renewable energy. For example, the report recommends promoting and sharing  renewable energy through grids and trade. In this way, we can put energy into recycling, dispose of waste efficiently and reduce the smash up on the climate.

By switching to renewable energy, more people will be able to use electricity and support more economic activity. Renewable energy is not available and is becoming the best alternative, as excessive reliance on fuels and gases around the world can deplete it.
