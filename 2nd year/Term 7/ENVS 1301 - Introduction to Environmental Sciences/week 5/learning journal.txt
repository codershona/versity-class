Learning Journal Unit 5
Summarize, in Your own words (do not copy from the website) two of the methods for sustainable agriculture from “Solutions: Advance Sustainable Agriculture: Using science-based practices, we can produce abundant food  while preserving our soil, air and water” including all hyperlinks used.

List one method that you think would work well in your local village/town/region. Why would it work well? Explain.

Please outline in your own words, one other new thing you learned this week in the course. How does it apply to your life?

ANSWER:

Using sustainable methods guarantees not only  environmentally friendly methods, but also safe production of  the food  we eat. In the process of climate change, the use of biotechnology techniques to meet increasing food demand continues to grow. Stakeholders around the world continue to seek ways in which we can achieve food adequacy, using methods that are believed to be environmentally friendly. Sustainable agriculture documents describe how farmers sustainably manage their agricultural activities  to revitalize their land. Proper farm management can streamline food production.

It ought to be cited that ecosystems also are self-regulated to save you abuse of agricultural land, and plenty of elements are worried with inside the right functioning of the environment. Of course, human sports make a contribution extensively to 
the shape of ecosystems, however it's far simple that nature additionally performs that role. The  techniques defined in this newsletter consist of restoring soil fitness and diversifying agricultural landscapes. Soil restore enables the soil to feature at its best,the usage of techniques to keep away from soil depletion and harm to organisms. Scientists say decreasing the use of fertilizers and different chemicals, planting seize vegetation to save you soil erosion, timber across the farm to keep vitamins and water, and year-spherical to enhance soil fertility. We are selling alternating vegetation.

To diversify the agricultural landscape  and  to minimize the use of chemicals, farmers are encouraged to include more opportunities in agricultural activities such as raising animals and livestock. By managing part of the farm, you can  prevent soil erosion and protect soil nutrients.


The area I currently live in has little to do with agriculture, but given my rural areas, I think planting catch crops is a practical way to maintain soil health. Most farmers plant corn all year round because my community relies heavily on corn, the staple food of many households. Adding legumes like beans and peas  between  cornrows helps slow erosion, preserve nutrients, retain water and improve organic matter.


This week I learned the benefits of using renewable energy, however, the most intriguing part was to learn that we can reach 100% renewable energy usability by 2050.

In conclusion:
Sustainability is a collaborative effort, and when we all come together, we can achieve even more. Since agriculture is an important economic activity, sustainable measures can protect agriculture from future food shortages. Smallholders also need to be trained in sustainable farming methods.
