Your posts should cover the questions below in full, and be at least 300 words long. Then reply to and peer-review at least three other posts by next Wednesday 11:59PM UoPeople Time, and rate the posts and replies.

This week we are learning about climate change. Open the link to the IPCC report "Climate Change 2014” and read the “Summary for Decision Makers”.

Then, in your own words answer the following questions (do not copy and paste things from the site... use your own words to answer the following questions. It is okay if your English is not perfect, I do not mind, I just prefer to see your own words and thoughts on the topic):

What is this report about?

What climate change vulnerabilities are identified for your region?

Did they surprise you? Why or why not?

Describe (in your own words) three adaptation measures that have been proposed for addressing global climate change in your region.

In your opinion, which one is the most important? Why?

Outline two steps you could take to lower your climate impact. Check the Union of Concerned Scientists for some ideas.
Any materials cited should be referenced using the style guidelines established by the American Psychological Association (APA).

ANSWER:


In the beginning, the report can be assumed that, this week is about analyzing and identifying climate and natural changes that can threaten the environment and a variety of organisms. Describes the environmental impact of climate change in terms of vulnerability, danger and exposure.

The identified vulnerabilities to climate change are excessive heat and delayed rainfall. This leads to clothing culture, as you have to wear fabrics that do not absorb heat. It also had a negative effect on plant production. Certain food crops, believed to be abundant, were not because their growth was largely dependent on rainfall. This year's rain delay or lightness also brought about an irregular power supply, as it is powered by hydropower in the country, for example we can assume about the Nigeria.

It was not surprised to see this, and the reason was there is little or no education facilities  to prevent people from contributing to global warming. Therefore, excessive heat and heat-related effects must be due to various activities that have contributed to climate evolve.

The following variation measures have been proposed from web page 21 of the report (for Africa).

Firstly, technical development need to be incorporated into agricultural rules, especially irrigation, to improve effective crop production, especially for drought-affected crops.

Secondly, the platforms want to be installation to assist agriculture thru studies to teach farmers on the way to offer drought-resistant plants and make certain non-stop productiveness in the course of droughts.

Thirdly, The sustainable urban development should be introduced to mitigate the adverse effects of floods, droughts and other climate changes.

The most important is the first-incorporation of technical interference into agricultural practices. This will enable large-scale plant production and increase farmers' income.

You can organize awareness campaigns to educate people about the risks and threats associated with global alerts and how to protect yourself from them. It also ensures action on human activities that contribute to climate change, such as deforestation and bush burning.
