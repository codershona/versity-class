Air pollution has become very costly environmental problem in terms of both human lives and in terms of billions of dollars lost for health-care expenditure and crop damage.

Contact the pollution control authorities in your community for the levels or air pollutants. Identify main air pollutants and the possible causes of air pollution. How does your community compare to others? Discuss your findings.

Consider your own skills and interests. Think of at least two skills or interests that could be applied (if you had the time and resources) to helping improve air quality in your community.

Your answer should be between 700â€“900 words long and should include introduction and conclusion section.

Air pollution is a serious problem all over the world, and both individuals and countries emit huge amounts of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere every day. These pollutants  not only endanger the health and well-being of plants, animals and humans, but  also contribute significantly to the latest climate changes observed around the earth.

Air pollution can be defined as any substance that can be harmful to the environment or living organisms. Air pollution can be divided into visible and invisible. Air pollution can be divided into two types: primary air pollutants and secondary air pollutants. The damage caused by air pollution varies from place to place and is determined by climate, social factors and geography. For example, the air pollution problem in Beijing is different from the air pollution problem in Los Angeles due to regional factors that are unique to both locations. In Saudi Arabia, the problem of air pollution  is unique in that it is caused by the large automobile industry, and efforts to solve the problem are cultural and location differences  to solve this problem. Should also be taken into account.


One of the primary and maximum crucial steps is to perceive a number of the maximum not unusual place and ample pollution, apprehend their origins, and apprehend their effects. This expertise will assist perceive the primary approaches which can assist lessen air pollutants and decrease the quantity of pollution with inside the surroundings across the world.

Environmentalists claim that pollutants are controlled within the kingdom. Strengthen cooperation between the Governor of Meteorology and the surrounding area. Schutz and other governments to raise public awareness of the importance of the environment and meteorology.

Abdulazziz Al Jasir, prinicipal based on Meteorological as well as Environmental Protection, President oversees the international development of technology, schooling and mathematical exploration as well as develops a complete pollution control system. In addition, factories that produce various pollutants should be more tightly controlled and fines should be reviewed in proportion to the degree of environmental damage.


Over the next five years, the Saudi Arabian government will  gradually and consistently enforce it. Regulations for managing factory emissions in line with the commitment as a signer of the Kyoto Protocol. Government agenda to transform the economy and privatize varied government agencies affect full-scale projects, especially oil, gas, petrochemical, water and power generation, spending as well as investment in cement factories,  manufacturers and air decomposition. Supplier of prevention and air quality monitoring systems.

Experts called for the establishment of a project on the importance of the environment and a national awareness campaign, as environmental safety is only guaranteed by individual participation. They also pointed out that  awareness campaigns are beneficial, but should be  carried out in a way that people can enjoy, rather than using harsh, useless methods.

Nizar Khudari, Pollution Advisor and Nanotechnology Associate Professor  at King Abdulazziz City for Science and Technology, calls for the establishment of a centralized pollution monitoring system that can provide people along with warning of pollution and air variance and develop citizens about pollution which I accomplished. A city that has a positive effect on the social awareness of environmental hygiene. He urged authorities to tightly control  factories that release pollutants into the atmosphere and drain daily sewage, rather  than installing filters that cost 100,000 SR.


Due to weather conditions, it is difficult to use  transportation other than refrigerated vehicles. Given the region's hot and dry climate, the problem of air pollution is exacerbated because the region's environment  is already sensitive to  weather conditions. The fewer cars  on the road, the  lower the emissions and the cleaner the air. And if Saudi Arabia can prevent Saudi Arabia from using the vehicle irresponsibly, things could improve. In Saudi Arabia, many people surf the dunes in their cars. This means you don't need a lot of Saudis and you drive for fun. Unfortunately, this trend has little effect. As you can imagine, this kingdom has one of the highest car accident rates  in the world. There is an urgent need for policy changes  to improve the situation in the Kingdom. Some useful changes are to make the streets safer for women, encourage carpooling, and impose stricter penalties for irresponsible car use.


Al Thbaiti says drinking contaminated water that needs treatment can make you sick, and scientifically and specifically warns you not to eat uncovered or contaminated food to protect yourself from food poisoning. Did. "I hope we can start a national  environmental awareness project that helps protect the environment in every way, and that project should include educational seminars and conferences for the community," he said. Al Thubaiti said meteorology is a topic that deals with  climate and  weather in a scientific way. "The world has made great strides in this area, especially in surveillance mechanisms and radar. All of these advances provide accurate, evidence-based information rather than expectations between members of society and social networks. Should help. "
