There are many current projects around the world to support sustainable development and growth in urban areas. The general goal is to create livable cities in which people have open spaces, nature, and areas for congregation and relaxation. The idea is also to have well developed public transport systems that would reduce the need for cars and other transport that contribute to air pollution. Through good education programs, there can be less litter and reduced waste. Finally, the thoughtful use of more eco-friendly products, renewable energy, and materials can make a huge difference in reducing both waste production and energy use. Basically, cities can be built and developed in a way that is healthy for the local environment as well as those living within the city. Curitiba, Brazil, is a city that has become a model of sustainable city growth and quality urban planning. At the following links, you can learn more about the different ways in which Curitiba, and its mayor, have supported sustainable, environmentally friendly, urban growth.

ANSWER:


Q/1) What is the most significant change or project in the city of Curitiba that you feel has influenced it.

Curitiba is known as Brazil's ecological capital. Many cities around the world utilize it as a model for long-term growth. Curitiba saw a population boom in the 1940s and 1950s, with population growth outpacingcity development (Britannica, 2019). Curitiba's governor implemented a master plan in the 1960s toreorganize the city and plan for future growth (Britannica, 2019). The master plan aims to improve thecity's transportation infrastructure, extend parkland, and create zoning to alleviate traffic congestion,among other things. I believe that the transformation system and zoning reform transformed Curitiba inthe 1950s into the Curitiba we know  today. Zoning designates  a   use for  a specific   region, such asresidential, business, or industrial, among others. The city can forecast, plan, and adjust changes morereadily by designating zones since areas are divided and isolated from one another, resulting in a morestructured metropolis (Britannica, 2019). The transformation reform makes public transportation moreefficient, resulting in less traffic congestion and shorter trip times. Better public transportation systemsbenefit   the   environment   by   making   all   locations   easily   accessible,   giving   individuals   an   alternatetransportation mode to drive their automobiles.

Q/2) 

Curitiba is  not exactly a perfect  nirvana. This   city, like  most others has  its challenges and issues.Overcrowding, poverty, and other challenges are some of the city's current concerns (Gnatec, 2003).However, many intelligent and creative planners and architects have designed in a very cost-effectiveway to contribute to the city's current urban prosperity since the early twentieth century (Britannica,2019). There is still much to be done, such as lowering the city's unemployment rate. Another criticalfactor is that Curitiba city requires younger, more ambitious, and hardworking leaders to maintain itscurrent urban success while also controlling the city's population to ensure its long-term viability.

Q/3)

My city, like Curitiba, has implemented many of the same schemes, such as the Bus Rapid Transit System.Bus lanes have been established. The BRT, as we affectionately refer to it, was a game-changer for us. Atfirst, it was met with skepticism, mainly because the installation of dedicated lanes had a negative andtemporary influence on traffic flow. However, once they were established, many people preferred it as amode of transportation over their automobiles, reducing traffic and pollution. That, I feel, is the drivingforce behind my city's significant accomplishments.
