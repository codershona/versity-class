Of the different kinds of ecosystem services you learned about, discuss two that are important in your local area, village, forests and/or nation.

How are these services endangered and what economic costs to society do you foresee with their loss?
For example, when people built homes and buildings over wetlands in Florida, then the wetlands were destroyed. Normally, wetlands are important to help control flooding, and without them, there were more floods and water damage in cities, which caused a lot of economic costs to the citizens. So, now Florida is trying to restore many lost wetlands in order to have the ecosystem service of flood control returned.

What is one action that people could take to help protect these services?

One or two sentences or your own personal reflection on something you learned this week.


ANSWER:
Q1.

An ecosystem has a community which lives for the organisms in conjunction into the non-living components in the environment and interact in to the system. The most important part of the ecosystem is humans because the dependent various services the given by the different components to make present of the ecosystem like water or soil. The various parts of the ecosystem services can be produced the food and water to make regulate nutrient cultural. The most important ecosystem services for the local area had impact to secure of local people from the sun where it has harmful ultraviolet rays.


Q2. 

In my second point of the view, the environment as well as the ecosystem can be polluted and it is the most important negative impact for our environment to provide the advantages in the ecosystems. We need to make people aware to not pollute the environment by their daily activities and consists with dumping wastes into the river or sea or ponds. The companies and local people need to use petroleum and build a new building make continuous by running of the generator. 

Q3. 

We can see that there could be various actions that need to take steps to eliminate and protect the environmental problems which basically produced the sir pollution and need to assist the ecosystem services. Another steps can be taken to reduce the effects of the environment pollution and we need to spend time to reduce of diesel or petrol generator. WE also needs to reduce uses and the number of cars and choose eco-friendly cars for our daily life uses. Furthermore, to protect ecosystem services we need to use the important regulations and build any houses or building according to authority selected place so that dumping wastes indoor sea overs into the river will be reduced. The implication of the economic human activities needs to be seen by the raining season. So that, the river overflow into the banks and securing destruction for the houses. 

Q4. 

As a result, the ecosystem needs to be protected by the people who were equally part of the great advantages and this ecosystem needs to be secure for the great humanity.
