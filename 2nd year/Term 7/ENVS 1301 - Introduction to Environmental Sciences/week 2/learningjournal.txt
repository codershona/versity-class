Furthermore, I use mosquito spray so that it will help to reduce the mosquito in my room and protect me from biting mosquito. Thus, I had tried to ignore the household from paying for 15 dollars for the sickness in every month so that the waste collection team in my municipality come and take and collect my waste bin bags.
