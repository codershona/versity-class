The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) assessed the consequences of ecosystem change on human well-being. From 2001 to 2005, the MEA involved the work of more than 1,360 experts worldwide. Their findings provide state-of-the-art scientific appraisal of the condition and trends in the world's ecosystems and the services they provide, as well as the scientific basis for action to conserve and use them sustainably.

Open the link to the report "Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Health Synthesis”. To understand the health impacts of ecosystem change, read the "Summary for Decision Makers”, pages 1-10 of this document. Then answer the following questions:

ANSWER:



ANSWER 1: Basically, the report was about the MEA, which can be accessed by the impacts of any activity that could be human on our world's ecosystem and this can buy reciprocal impact by the humanity in the ecosystem and unable to balance any activity. It can also focus the report which is for the human health and it can occur which can loss in ecosystem services. 

ANSWER 2: In the second point of the view, I had to learn the large effects to imbalanced in our ecosystem. It is also complex to measure the disruptions in our ecosystem. Disability adjusted life is another metric that can access the health effect in our ecosystem difference. It also represents the sum of the years and people lost life which is known as premature death. Premature death means people who died in the actual age which is compared with the natural life expectancy. We can also enable the measurement of the health effects and intimate the outcome in various ways to multiply with the general pathways if we count altogether.  

ANSWER 3: Moreover, Here I prefer fighting for malaria and it is main responsible for the daily impact for roughly 46 million people. Many people die in every per minute for malaria. The American Aid list in the beginning can make combat of protozal for the infection because indoor residual spray for the insecticide can be treated for the mosquito nets. For the pregnant women it can be another preventative treatment and to rescue medicine we can diagnose. We can also choose the treatment in two ways one is IRS and another one is ITMs. The whole population can be preventative. 

ANSWER 4: At last, if anyone asks me how I could diverse our work I would like to talk about the responsible of the people for the personal environmental impacts. It is also another important things to talk about as the big damages occur in the ecosystem because the companies in developed nations and it has also another deal in the economic or military power to burn via large amount of resources. It can cause another ecological damages and many people left countries in each position so that it can be ignored of the issue. These impacts can be lost from the ecosystem of the services. There is another reason why the economic power can be imported food and other resource. Poor nations the only nation who are dependent on their local ecosystem. To survive for the poor peoples it directly male impacts and loss of the services of the ecosystem.
