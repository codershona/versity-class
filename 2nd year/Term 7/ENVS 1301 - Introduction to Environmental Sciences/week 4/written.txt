 Earth is the only planet in our solar system that provides a suitable environment for life as we know it. Sustaining these conditions requires a constant recycling of materials between the living and nonliving components of eco-systems.

Select one of material cycles we studied (water, nitrogen, carbon, sulphur and phosphorus) and identify elements of your lifestyle that impact the cycle.

a.    What are the most considerable impacts you make?
b.    How might it change your life if you were to reduce your impacts? What would you need to give up?
c.    How difficult is to balance personal choices with environmental considerations?

Your answer should be between 700â€“900 words long and should include introduction and conclusion sections.


ANSWER:


Introduction

The most important for our life is water. Without water we cannot survive on planet earth and humans are depends on water for different domestic activities for example washing cloths or anythings, cooking foods, cleaning hiuse or any place etc. By generating electrical power and cultivating crops we use water in many Economic purpose. There isonly less than 1 percent possibility to get fresh water available. We need to increase the availability of the water more and make the mechanisms to access the groundwater beuase the supply water in not enough for us to survive. This process of water cycle is important to circulate among the ocean and the atmosphere and has various states of land. Some water cycle has elements like evaporation, condensation as well as precipitation. This is most important for our life and without water cycle availability it would be difficult for us. 

What are the most considerable impacts you make?

Firstly, the water cycle can be affected by the human activities straightly or not immediately. The water can be granted and make available and also can collected the free water from rainfall or underground sources and buy any piped water. WE can examine in our life and we can also realize to make affect in the water cycle in different ways which I never think about it. 



The first of it is my use of electricity. Ghana generates electricity from hydro dams.The main ones I know of are the Akosombo dam and the Kpong dam. I use electricity daily for different purposes. Thinking about it, I realize I impact the water cycle indirectly. Hydroelectric power are generated from the energy of water stored in dams. A dam is a wall or structure built over lakes or rivers to hold water. These cause significant changes to the water supply in other areas not near the dam. It also affects water levels downstream.  Our constant dependence on hydroelectricity, in the long run, affects the water cycle. The second impact I make is through water abstraction. My community does not have access to pipe water at the moment. Our primary sources of water for domestic activities are from collecting rainwater or using well water. Digging wellsto harvest groundwater provides us with the water we need but also causes impactson the cycling of water. We used to draw water from wells by hand, but now we use pumping machines. These pumping machines help us to draw more water fromthe wells. That has led to water misuse, as we do not tire to get the water. It leads tothe drying up of the wells in the dry season as we use the water more than it gets replenished.Indirect ways I affect the cycle are by the food I consume. Irrigation is used to water farms throughout the year except during the wet or rainy seasons. Irrigation leads to leaching, depletion of surface water used. I sometimes use charcoal for food preparation. This charcoal comes from trees that fell in the forests. Deforestation reduces the trees hence the trans evaporation and rainfall in the long run.


How might it change your life if you were to reduce your impacts? What would you need to give up?

We can also noticed that the rainfall pattern has been changed dramatiscally in our last years. We can use drying up again and again. The outcome of our stable dependence on water and it can get better set in basic ways. We can also think about the way we can use hydroelectricity and adopt utilize of solar energy. The source of energy can be used for renewable as the sun and we cannot entirely allowance to use water from wells. In my community water needs to be available in the beginning, we can also reduce the amount of water daily basis for our economically pourpose. We can also find backup source of the fule to cook foods and kickback the charcoal. 

How difficult is it to balance personal choices with environmental considerations?

The Environmental Considerations are another daunting task to make balance in our personal choices. Without it we cannot imagine on our ecosystem. This helps to reduce our impacts. 

Conclusion :

Last but not least, we had may choices to eat food, wear clothes, use furniture or energy. Without it making impact on our environment. This also depend on our ecosystem services. It assist to reduce the effects in our environment and we can make ensure the sustainability services for our future.
