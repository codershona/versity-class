Earth is the only planet in our solar system that provides a suitable environment for life as we know it. Sustaining these conditions requires a constant recycling of materials between the living and nonliving components of eco-systems.

Select one of material cycles we studied (water, nitrogen, carbon, sulphur and phosphorus) and identify elements of your lifestyle that impact the cycle.

a.    What are the most considerable impacts you make?
b.    How might it change your life if you were to reduce your impacts? What would you need to give up?
c.    How difficult is to balance personal choices with environmental considerations?

Your answer should be between 700â€“900 words long and should include introduction and conclusion sections.


ANSWER:


Introduction


Water is vital to life on earth. Survival on planet earth is impossible without water. Humans depend on water for various domestic activities such as washing, cooking,self-hygiene, cleaning. Economic uses of water include cultivating crops and generating electrical power etc. The percentage of fresh water available for use is less than 1%. That has caused us to develop ways to increase the availability of water. Even with the availability of mechanisms to access groundwater, the supply of freshwater is still not enough to support us. [ CITATION Dor20 \l 1033 ]The water cycle is the process of water circulating between oceans, the atmosphere, and land in different states. Evaporation, condensation, and precipitation are some elements of the cycle. The water cycle is essential to life. Without it, water will not be available continuously, and we would run out of waterat a point. 

What are the most considerable impacts you make?


The water cycle is affected by human activities either directly or indirectly. Many of us take the availability of water for granted. Water can be collected for free fromrainfall, underground sources, or bought as treated pipe water. After examining my life, I realized that I  impact the water cycle in various ways I never thought.


The first of it is my use of electricity. Ghana generates electricity from hydro dams.The main ones I know of are the Akosombo dam and the Kpong dam. I use electricity daily for different purposes. Thinking about it, I realize I impact the water cycle indirectly. Hydroelectric power are generated from the energy of water stored in dams. A dam is a wall or structure built over lakes or rivers to hold water. These cause significant changes to the water supply in other areas not near the dam. It also affects water levels downstream.  Our constant dependence on hydroelectricity, in the long run, affects the water cycle. The second impact I make is through water abstraction. My community does not have access to pipe water at the moment. Our primary sources of water for domestic activities are from collecting rainwater or using well water. Digging wellsto harvest groundwater provides us with the water we need but also causes impactson the cycling of water. We used to draw water from wells by hand, but now we use pumping machines. These pumping machines help us to draw more water fromthe wells. That has led to water misuse, as we do not tire to get the water. It leads tothe drying up of the wells in the dry season as we use the water more than it gets replenished.Indirect ways I affect the cycle are by the food I consume. Irrigation is used to water farms throughout the year except during the wet or rainy seasons. Irrigation leads to leaching, depletion of surface water used. I sometimes use charcoal for food preparation. This charcoal comes from trees that fell in the forests. Deforestation reduces the trees hence the trans evaporation and rainfall in the long run.


How might it change your life if you were to reduce your impacts? What would you need to give up?

I noticed that the rainfall pattern changed significantly over the years. The wells weuse have been drying up more frequently. These are a result of our constant dependence on water. Things will get better if the impacts we make are minimal. Thinking about it, I may have to give up using hydroelectricity and adopt using solar energy. Solar energy is renewable as the sun is the source of energy.I cannot entirely give up using water from wells as that is the primary water available in my community. I can reduce the amount of water I use daily by using water more economically. I may also need to find an alternate source of fuel for cooking and give up charcoal. 

How difficult is it to balance personal choices with environmental considerations?

It is a very daunting task to balance personal choices with environmental considerations. There are certain aspects of the ecosystem that we cannot do without. There are others we can reduce our impacts.


Conclusion :

Our choices from the food we eat, the clothes we wear, furniture, energy, etc., havean impact on the environment. In as much as we depend on ecosystem services for our survival, we must reduce the impact we make on the environment to ensure thesustainability of these services in the future.
