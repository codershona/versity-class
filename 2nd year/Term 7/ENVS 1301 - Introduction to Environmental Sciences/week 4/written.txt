Earth is the only planet in our solar system that provides a suitable environment for life as we know it. Sustaining these conditions requires a constant recycling of materials between the living and nonliving components of eco-systems.

Select one of material cycles we studied (water, nitrogen, carbon, sulphur and phosphorus) and identify elements of your lifestyle that impact the cycle.

a.    What are the most considerable impacts you make?
b.    How might it change your life if you were to reduce your impacts? What would you need to give up?
c.    How difficult is to balance personal choices with environmental considerations?

Your answer should be between 700â€“900 words long and should include introduction and conclusion sections.
