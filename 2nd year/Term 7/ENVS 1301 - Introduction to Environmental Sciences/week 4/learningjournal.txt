What kind of labels are listed here? Why?

How do your consumer (buying) choices affect biodiversity?

Pick one of these methods that you feel would be usable in YOUR city/village/town. How? Explain.

One or two sentences or your own personal reflection on something you learned this week.

How is the class going so far for you?

ANSWER:

Answer 1: In the beginning, I would like to go through about the kinds of labels. If we observe in our 21st century we would never pay for any attention for the different labels. It is also sad to talk about the Rain Forest. It also needs to remember me those sad times where everyday deforestation used to take place. I hop I could able to realize people to not to cut tress and destroy the forest. Many companies such as Rainforest Alliance came to assist but it is also require understanding people to keep engaged to rescue the natural resource of our planet.  

Answer 2: In my second point of the view, my choices for the consumer would something different. It means consumer choices can affect our biodiversity. Because when the consumer product becomes in budget price from the forest and it plays another important role in our life. Moreover, consumers can make a promotion to secure and make protect our forest and buy wood types of products which are made by certified sustainable wood. This wood can come from sustainable forestry and make ensure about the ratio of timber harvest. But it does not exceed the ratio growth of the timber. We can also promote to people to use wood for productivity and protect our forest and water and natural resources. 


Answer 3: In the third point of view, there was a method which has easy to utilize the plastic by recycling them in the city rather than burning them. If we want to protect our biodiversity, we need to be more responsible to take care of our environment. Rural areas are more important to take care of in the environment rather than taking care of urban areas. If we burn plastics and garbage it would affect our ozone layer. In this case we can recycle them and more helpful and earn money from them. 

Answer 4: In this week, I had able to learn new things, which is about the two broad categories about the environment-health risk. We can call this as traditional or modern hazards. Moreover, I had learned about the 4 important pillars of food protection which has availability and accessibility and stability. 

Answer 5: In my fifth point of the view, the class would go for informative and educative for our everyday life. The reason is this is important information to get encourage student about us in the class and learn more 6to 8 hours everyday. I would prefer to encourage to take admission in any degree related Environmental Science.
