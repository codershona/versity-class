ANSWER:

The chronic illness that I have chosen is diabetes. There are psychological issues that co-occurwith diabetes such as feeling worried, anxiety, poor eating habits and diabetes distress. Forexample a person who is diagnosed with diabetes will be restricted from eating certain favoritemeals and this may affect them psychologically because of the changed mind set. During thediagnosis   process   a   person   might   feel   tired,   have   excessive   thirst,   hunger,   and   excessiveurination, weight loss, skin wounds that heal poorly, and blurred vision if the glucose levels arevery   high   (Rebecca,   2017).  When  going   through   symptoms   management   and   treatments,  aperson may be put under nutrition management, exercising because it lowers the blood glucoselevel, monitoring glucose level, and medication therapy where the patient is given some drugs tocontrol the blood sugar level and psychology it can affect them.


As friend, I would ensure that the patient with this chronic disease for example if he drinksalcohol heavily,  I would enlighten him concerning the effects of drinking which triggers theblood sugar making it fall below the recommended level which mostly may result to automaticdeath. I would also ensure that, the patient has adhered to the medication regimen so as to avoidresistance of those medicines in the body system for. Also, I would also change the entire familydiet so as to encourage the ailing family member to be able to adjust and feel not left out. Thepatient must embrace the new prescribed diet in order to control the blood sugar level.
