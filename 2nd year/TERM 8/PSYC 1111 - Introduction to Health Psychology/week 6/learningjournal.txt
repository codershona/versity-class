The Learning Journal should be at least 400 words and not more than 750 words.


ANSWER:

ANSWER 1:

Honestly with all due respect, I know that discussion forums have to be completed by Wednesday, but I do not like it when people have not posted by Sunday to the discussion forums. A lot of other instructorsenforce this requirement and mark down grades after Sundays when students have not posted. It has happened to me too. I think the reasoning is because you cannot really have a quality conversation in the discussion forums if people are submitting on Tuesday or Wednesday evenings just before the shut off time. It’s also unfair to other students that have posted early. In context, what I mean is that studentswho post early provide feedback, are engaged and open for a discussion, the students who post late are not engaged, provide no quality feedback and no chance for discussion. While the intent is to provide a social constructivist learning experience it often falls short or obtaining those goals (Morrison, 2013).

In the Written Assignments, the feedback is basic, mundane, and sometimes written in error. If there is any feedback it may end up being constructive but more often than not it is not of any real value. I sometimes get the feeling that the reviewers also feel like they are the shadow professor when it comes to written assignment assessments. When one of my peers writes “there were grammar mistakes…” thatis of no value if they are not pointing them out specifically. In my case this has happened, but I also use Grammarly and although the passive voice is used sometimes, my written assignments are submitted with no inaccurate grammar or spelling errors. Or when I have completed an assignment, I should not have to list an exhaustive number of issues related to acupuncture for example – the list would be endless - but I got downgraded by a peer for not introducing the fear of needles as “perhaps the fear of needles (which is plenty) could've helped” which just invalidates my entire paper. What is the point in trying to get 0.65% every week? Bloom's taxonomy of learning is definitely at play (Armstrong, 2010).

I also know we are in multicultural environment but there appears to be students who cannot translate the transition or context of meaning across paragraphs or who do not understand the exercise well enough that they should not be grading someone’s work, as Morrison (2013) also points out. Also, if I have met all of the rubrics requirements why do some peers feel compelled to mark an individual down. For example, I met all of the rubric requirements in in a WA, and the student agreed I had but did not provide full marks without any explanation. These kinds of actions are unnecessary and disheartening when you have written a paper whether good or bad. Everyone should be assumed to be 10 until they are provided the feedback that they deserve.


ANSWER 2:

With regard to providing feedback, I do not know they take it. I try to be a good steward of the process and provide insight from my experience if it is relevant, and from I have read or understood during the course. I try to ask thought provoking questions of others to elicit a response and sometimes you will geta good response and carry on a conversation, often you do not. In the assignments we have to correct I try to provide constructive feedback and point out errors and hope it is taken positively because it is done with honesty and integrity.
