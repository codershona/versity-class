Write about psychological influences on pain perception. Specifically discuss the Gate Control Theory of Pain by Melzack and Wall (1965), analyzing factors that can open the gate and factors that can close the gate. Consider this in relation to the reading by Ressler et al. (2012), on the positive effects of blogging about chronic pain and illness. Discuss blogging in the context of psychological moderators such as stress, coping, social support, control, and personality.
