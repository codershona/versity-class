Learning Journal Unit 5
As you consider what you’ve learned about pain and stress this week, write about one theory you found especially interesting (either from the textbook or one of the articles). Include examples of how this theory could be applied to potentially improve your health or to help someone in your family or circle of friends. Also, include ideas about how this theory could potentially be applied to improve health at the community level.  

The Learning Journal entry should be a minimum of 400 words and not more than 750 words. Use APA citations and references if you use ideas from the readings or other sources.


ANSWER:



I suffer from severe menstrual cramps every month, the pain on a scale of 1 to 10 is a 9. Just imagine having to experience that kind of pain every month, it is the worse. Throughout the years I have also found ways to cope with the pain.  After learning so much about pain this week,  I consider Melzak and Wall’s gate control theory of pain very interesting and relate well tomy life situations. The theory has taught me that pain is affected by different factors, not just the physiological factors but the psychosocial factors as well. The gate control theory of pain observed the effect of psychology on pain perception and made it clear that pain perception is very much complex (Ogden, 2019). The theory integrates the psychological concept into the traditional biomedical pain model, considering how thoughts and emotions influence the experience of pain (Ogden, 2019). According to the theory, small nerve fibres known as pain receptors and large nerve fibres known as normal receptors meet on a projection cell that leads to the brain. When a stimulus is present, the interplay of these connections decides when pain stimuli reach the brain also known as opening the gate. Over recent years the gate control theory of pain has been elaborated upon by focusing on the role of learning, emotions, cognitions, and behaviour (Ogden, 2019).


After learning this theory, I feel that it will have great help in terms of when aiding me with coping with the pain. This theory has taught me that using the cognitive process of distraction, can help a great deal in diverting my attention away from the pain. Because pain need cognitionto be able to be processed so when I am doing other things and not letting the pain be processed, so lesser gates can be open, in turn helping me to not perceive the pain as much. I have also learned from the emotional process that negative feelings can enhance the perceived pain you are getting so keeping a optimistic mindset and not letting oneself be depressed when experiencing pain is very important. For me I feel, in order to not let the pain get to me is to surround myself with friends and family when I am in pain so that they can help me distract the pain away.

The Gate Control Theory of Pain can be applied for the improvement of health at the communitylevel by introducing acupunctures treatment.  This is done using a thin needle at the back that activates pain fibres which are designed to close pain gates (William, 2017) Listening to music can also be a great help in distracting pain. Music is used as a therapy whereby the brain is authorized to send a signal to the spinal cord to adjacent the pain gate while also minimizing thepain signal to the brain. Relaxation such as massage can help to decrease anxiety and stress,and consequently, decrease pain.
