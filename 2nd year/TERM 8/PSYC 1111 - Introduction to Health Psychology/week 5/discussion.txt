ANSWER:


Firstly, The last time I was really stressed out was back in 2019 when I was still studying for my Dental Hygienist course. It was my final year and I was having an internship in one of the countryâ€™s best Oral Health Centres. This course was a very niche course in my country and they only accept 20 to 25 applicants every year, so I considered myself lucky to be in. With the little cohort size, it quickly became very competitive. Since it was my final year, I was determined to give it my very best and this made me very stressed out. I used emotion-focused coping which is a type of stress management that helps to minimizenegative emotional responses that arise as a result of stressful events (Ogden, 2019),  to cope with the stress I was feeling. In the course, I used the behavioral strategy by approaching a couple of my close friends in the course to talk about my feelings and problems.


Secondly, Also because of the stress, I started skipping my meals during lunchtime to get a head start on preparing for the next afternoon patient. This ultimately leads to the development of gastritis. If I didn't eat my meals on time, the pain would be excruciating. Finally, I went to the doctor, where I was prescribed gastric medicine and advised to monitor my diet. With this type of stress, I used an approach coping strategy in which I started to approach the issue by collecting constructive information online and implementing a direct action plan for my diet.


Thirdly, I believe it should begin with yourself, the individual need to recognize that they are in a difficult position and experiencing an illness. They need to try figuring out what they can and can't manage/do. I feel that it is important to also need to find information on different coping skills for times where one cannot manage,lastly the mental and emotional support from people they trust and believe will be of great assistance.
