ANSWER:



Health –related quality of life is a concept that measures an individual’s wellbeing. It includes domains related to social functioning, mental, psychological state, emotional, and an individual's physical health  (Ogden,   2017).   This   concept   goes   beyond   immediate   measures   of life expectancy, health populations, and focuses on the effect health status has on quality of life. I had a friend of mine who had kidney failure disease. During the early stages of this illness, he was expected to go on dialysis three or four times a week. This affected him very much and all he could   see   was   death.     He   experienced   multiple   losses;   for   example   limitation   of normal functionality, loss of physical strength, associated comorbidities, independence, medication side effects, freedom, and social life, decreasing his quality of life. He went through a state of rejection by his family members, anger, resistance and later his own depression; this negatively impacted his quality of life.


Later on, my friend underwent kidney transplant treatment which was considered the best choice by his doctor as he stated that this kind of treatment was associated with lower mortality and a healthier psychosocial outcome compared to undergoing dialysis. This treatment improved his quality   of   life; however;   the   quality   is   still   lower   compared   to   that   of   general population. Sometimes, he does experience health anxiety, sleep disturbances, cognitive disturbances and sometimes pain due to medication side effects. It is now five years since he received a kidney donor and so far he is becoming active, returning to his sense of normality, to his life. Question: What is the importance of health-related quality of life?
