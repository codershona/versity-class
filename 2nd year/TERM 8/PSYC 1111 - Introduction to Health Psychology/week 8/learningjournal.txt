ANSWER:


There a lot of questions that we have as individuals that cannot be answered in real terms. For example, the questions on how we can maintain, protect, and recover our health, as long as there is no logical meaning to health, and how it can be measured. I came to understand that, health psychology provides us with a broad-minded approach to understanding our health, informing and educating us, helping us understand that we can take control of our overall well-being. When we understand how and why our bodies are responding to certain physical problems, we are better able to accept solutions. One of the models that can support my insights is the biopsychosocial model which was developed by Engel (1977), which suggested that, for one to understand anindividual’s medical condition it is not simply the biological factors should be considered, but also the social factors and psychological factors (Ogden, 2017).


The biological aspect studies the psychological causes of a disease. According to this model, the psychological cause alone is not enough to conclude the occurrence of an illness in the body, unless it is accompanied by the other two aspects of this model as well. Many disorders or illnesses have certain biological factors at their base, such as low immunity, genetic issues and hormones.   The psychological aspect on the other hand, suggests that when an individual is ill there might be some underlying mental states that contribute to the symptoms of that illness. Identifying any  psychological  issues that  may be affecting  an individual’s  health, directly or indirectly, such as, negative thinking, depression, low self-esteem, and addiction, helps medical experts to understand how to handle certain illnesses (Ogden, 2017).


The social feature of the biopsychosocial model looks at the environment that surrounds a sick person. Medical experts analyze the illness from a sociological point of view, and later to determine what external factors may have contributed to the manifestation of the disease in the patient. Through the knowledge gained after going through this model, one can help a friend or a family member in managing chronic conditions or helping them find ways to avoid avoidable diseases by living a healthy lifestyle. I plan to use what I have learned by studying underlying behaviors, and various activities that impact my social and wellbeing. By focusing on health-enhancing activities such as reducing risky behaviors, exercising and on how to develop strategies that can influence my friends and family to change behaviors to promote better health.
