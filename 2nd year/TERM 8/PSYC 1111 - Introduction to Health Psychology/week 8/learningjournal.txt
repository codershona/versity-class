ANSWER:


There a number of question that we have as individuals that cannot be answered in real terms.For example, the questions on how we can maintain, protect, and recover our health, as long asthere is no logical meaning to health, and how it can be measured. I came to understand that,health psychology provide us with a broad-minded approach to understand our health, informingand educating us, helping us understand that we can take control of our overall well-being. Whenwe understand how and why our bodies are responding to certain physical problem, we are betterable to accept solutions. One of the models that can support my insights is the biopsychosocialmodel which was developed by Engel (1977), which suggested that, for one to understand anindividual’s medical condition it is not simply the biological factors should be considered, butalso the social factors and psychological factors (Ogden, 2017).


The biological aspect studies the psychological causes of a disease. According to this model, thepsychological cause alone is not enough to conclude the occurrence of an illness in the body,unless it is accompanied by the other two aspects of this model as well. Many disorders orillnesses have certain biological factors at their base, such as low immunity, genetic issues andhormones.   The psychological aspect on the other hand suggests that when an individual is illthere might be some underlying mental states that contribute to the symptoms of that illness.Identifying any  psychological  issues that  may be affecting  an individual’s  health directly orindirectly such as, negative thinking, depression, low self-esteem, and addiction helps medicalexperts to understand how to handle certain illness(Ogden, 2017).


The social feature of the biopsychosocial model looks at the environment that surrounds a sickperson.  Medical experts analyze  the illness from  a  sociological  point  of view,  and later  ondetermine what external factors may have contributed to the manifestation of the disease in thepatient.   Through the knowledge gained after going through this model, one can help a friend ora family member in managing chronic conditions or helping them find ways to avoid avoidablediseases by living a healthy lifestyle. I plan to use what I have learned by studying underlyingbehaviors,   and   various   activities   impact   my   social   and   wellbeing.   By   focusing   on   health-enhancing activities such reducing risky behaviors, exercising and on how to develop strategiesthat can influence my friends and family to change behaviors to promote a better health.
