The textbook and video highlighted differences in illness and symptoms for males and females. There are also differences in health outcomes, with females on average living longer than males. Describe at least 3-4 of the potential explanations for these differences. The textbook lists several examples on pages 86-90. Make sure to use your own words to share these ideas and include APA citations. Example: (Ogden, 2019).
