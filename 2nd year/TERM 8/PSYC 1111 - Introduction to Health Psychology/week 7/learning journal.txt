Learning Journal Unit 7
As you reflect on the ideas presented this week, how do you think that common gender stereotypes could negatively affect patients in health care settings? In psychology, it is assumed that everyone has some biases. Consider your own biases and whether they could potentially affect your treatment of others. What strategies could be used to counteract these biases? Include hypothetical examples and/or personal examples if applicable. 

The Learning Journal entry should be a minimum of 400 words and not more than 750 words. Use APA citations and references if you use ideas from the readings or other sources.



ANSWER:



The stereotype in healthcare causes an adverse effect, making the patient feel worst. If peopleseeking healthcare faces stereotype due to their weight, age, gender, or social class, it may cause them to doubt what the doctor has diagnosed or they may feel motivated to seek additional care (Aronson et al., 2013).  A man I know was hospitalized for kidney problems and he refuses to go back to the hospital as he faced healthcare stereotype.  He told me, that the minute he walked into the facility he felt uncomfortable and less than a man.  He is poor and a comment was made, that for a big man, he should be able to afford his medication.



A few days ago, a homeless person fainted at the shelter I operate and when rushed to the hospital, though unresponsive, was pushed in a corner.  The member of staff who took him to the hospital called me in distress, when I spoke with the head of the Accident of Emergency Department, her expression was, “Why didn’t the young man tell me he came from your shelter?”,  This just goes to show that who you are could be the determining factor for the service you receive.


As a child’s character forms, they learn from their environment how to treat others.  By age three, a child's brain would be approximately 90% of the expected adult size (Winston & Chicot, 2016), and by age eight, their cognitive development would be advanced (Allen, 2015).  Based on early cognitive development studies, labels help children place things into groups, so, when children are referred to as boys and girls, it gives them a mental image of what each sex should look like and the same for other groupings (Allen, 2015).  It is what we learn in those formative years that resonates.


Where gender is concerned, we see men as assertive, brave and they should show no sign of weakness, while women are expected to be nurturing, caring, and show less authority.  I learned to accept people for who they are and not to judge based on my perception, I live by the mantra, “Don’t judge a book by its cover”. I am also mindful of the story my grandmothertaught me about a farmer, who went to buy a car and the salesperson laughed him to scorn, telling him to leave the showroom, little did he know that the bag the man had contained cashto make the purchase.


Despite all this, I still find it difficult to tolerate simple men, in other words, I like to see when men are assertive, smart, and move with alacrity. Simple men make me cringe.  Thank goodness for age and experience, which has taught me to be patient and tactful.  It used to be so easy for me to tell them how their simplicity makes me feel like I am dealing with a female.  Now, I am more mindful of the effect of stereotyping and the spoken word.  Sometimes, I have to count to ten or repeat to myself, “May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in Thy sight…..”, so that I diminish my thoughts.


Case in point, a few months ago, a young man came to me for shelter, he was living on the streets after being released from the adult correctional center and was obviously in need of care. We live in a very homophobic society and in my younger days, the way he looked and his tone of voice would cause me to react negatively.  After hearing his story, I realized that he was incarcerated at a very young age and did not know what it felt like to be loved and would do anything to survive the streets.  He is now a changed person and often thanks me for helping him at a point when would others closed their doors.


There have been many instances when I have put my personal feelings aside for the common good. This is the reason why for most of my adult life, I have engaged in so many charitable projects as I know that regardless of one's perception of another, there is always some good ineveryone.  With this in mind, I have trained my staff to accept every person that goes to the shelter as though we are running a business and they are the best paying customer.
