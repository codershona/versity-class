ANSWER:


I grew up in a small village that was assumed to be good and at the same time dangerous mostlydue to high rate of crime, drug abuse for example, alcohol, smoking, and marijuana, and living arisky life style. To me, these activities were seen normal and okay amongst male (both young andold) and showed the masculinity side. Also, back in those days physical activities for examplesports was only restricted for males and females were not allowed to participate which made meunderstand that men do not fall ill as compared to females because they are physically strong(Ogden, 2017). Females were considered to be more emotional compared to men and also, peerpressure   amongst   young  males   was   very   high   in   that   they   encouraged   themselves   to   haveunprotected sex with different girls in order to show that they are men. This influenced on how Iperceived health beliefs for example I used to see myself as too weak since I did not participatein any physical activities. This made me less motivated with those physical activities since theywere meant for men. This encouraged me to use health care more and seeking for help.


Gender roles and social norms affected my health-related belief and behaviors for example I onlyknew that   physical   activities   were   meant   for   men   and  not  females   and   so   lack   of   physicalactivities affect our health in one way or another for example it can lead to high blood pressureand high blood cholesterol. Till now I am not that active when it comes to physical activities andthis affects my exercising behaviors which in turn can a negative impact to my health. My healthbelieves and behaviors tends towards the gender norm because I saw myself to be less strongerand emotional compared to men  and men taking drugs as normal and acceptable compared tofemales.
