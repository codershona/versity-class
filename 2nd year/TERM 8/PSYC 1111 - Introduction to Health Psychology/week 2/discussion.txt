ANSWER:



Being able to predict health-related behaviors helps people to have a chance change their lifestyleand avoid the cost of illnesss. For example, people may "held strong  fatalistic beliefs about thecause   and control  of diabetes, they still reported attempts to change their lifestylesbehaviours"(Patel, 2015, P. 7). These people are in the stage of Likelihood of behaviors accorrdingto  "the  Health Belief  Model  (HBM) was developed initially  by Rosenstock (1966)  and  further byBecker and colleagues throughout the 1970s and 1980s" (Ogden, 2019, P. 18). This is good not onlyfor individuals but also for the management levels to creat the health policy and facilities to tackler itsproblem in the future.

I think the models of belief and behavior are doing a good job. These tools are being counitous improving over time. I know there still factors that couldn't explained or to predict because they change over time or have own beliefs. I have strong believe that the effectiness will be around 75% of all self-practices cases because it's simple to understand and easy to follow these steps. Only they know what they need. There is an example that i heard from my friend about a hooker and using condom. The hooker had saw her friends die by HIV and she knew she will be in that case someday. Besides, her clients don't like using condom because it keeps the fun away. Strong believes about dying by HIV in future, she decided not to use condom. Then a person said to her that her child will become an orphan if she dies by HIV. Now, she use condom regularly. I think her behavior has changed because of the costs factor in HBM (Rosenstock), her child will be suffers without mother.
