Consider and reflect on the beliefs related to health in the general population where you live now (or where you have previously lived).  Consider common attributions people make about what causes health problems and the answers they might provide if asked why some people are very healthy while other people are very unhealthy. Are your own beliefs the same or different from those in your community? Write about your thoughts on this in relation to what you learned this week.  

The Learning Journal entry should be a minimum of 400 words and not more than 750 words. Use APA citations and references if you use ideas from the readings or other sources.

ANSWER:



The common beliefs related to health.

I think it's not uncommon to see infectious diseases unrelated to supernatural forces in Africa, especially blacks. For example, mental infections and illnesses are one of the fitness problems faced by young people, regardless of age, gender, or status. And this intellectual infection entails their fitness challenges because of the well-known ideals among parents regarding the purpose of the infection or illness. Because of the way they appear, they are aggressive, hostile, destructive, and sometimes tend to endanger their personal lives.

The common beliefs towards mental illness.


The famous idea of no smoke without fire, the health of these people's gifts, is because they are obsessed with God's punishment, magic, will of God, spells, or the devil. Their own circle of loved ones often relies on traditional healers and religious media to help find ways to soothe the gods. Cultural norms, ideals, and customs dispel the underlying motivations of the fitness struggle, and as a result, many of these young people are taken from adorable homes to traditional healers, depressing their lives. I made it meaningless. A family of these young people who blindly trust these traditional healers in the recognition that their sons and daughters have been turned into witches. Believe that you are looking at these traditional healers rather than taking them to a psychiatric health center for a proper rehabilitation assessment. People have a blind belief that they will be healed when they move to their religious medium and recover. But they have been fooled by their money. While taking care of these traditional healers, they exposed them to all sorts of physical abuse in order to free them from the devil's fingers they trusted. Some who have their own circle of relatives have been imprisoned and left dead.

My ideals and theirs aren't always the same. Before now, I believe and recognize that 80% of illness isn't always man-made. But, this week's dialogue has helped me to suppose severely approximately the foundation reason in their problem (mentally ill). So far, I should take a look at that those laid low with this contamination are ordinarily the youths, specifically the male gender. The position of perception and fitness behaviors famous we can provide an explanation for and expect contamination through fitness-associated behaviors which can move that human beings take which can enhance their wellness or harm their fitness, such as smoking, abuse of drugs, illicit sexual activity, loss of bodily exercise, dangerous diet. With this knowledge, I can explain the foundation reason for their fitness problem. How? Young human beings especially, misuse and abuse materials like drugs, cannabis, margarine, alcohol, and different neighborhood stimulants they use. And those fitness-associated behaviors are the primary motive for they are mentally ill.

Conclusion:

Literacy becomes the reason for those attitudes towards mentally unwell ones. Higher knowhow of this illness (mental), amongst communities, households, and the public who consider that those merits the kingdom they were, and the bad attitudes is important. Presently in that circumstance, they (the mentally ill) cannot extrude their conduct but, their households will assist via way of means of giving them the right clinical assistance, preventing stigmatizing them and rehabilitating them.
