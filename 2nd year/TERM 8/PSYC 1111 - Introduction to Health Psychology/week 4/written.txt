Conventional Treatment Or CAM Treatment


Introduction:

The  intensive use  of   Complementary   and Alternative   Medicine  (CAM)  is  one  of  the  majorsignificance to today’s health care customers, practitioners, researchers and policy makers. Mostof these alternative medicines are available for purchase on the shelf for consumers to select,unlike prescribed medicines by doctors. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) referto the use of medical products and practices not included in standard medical care. Some peopleadopt   these   practices   while   others   don't.   In   this   case,   we   will   discuss  Traditional   ChineseMedicine as an example.

Information about the Chinese Complementary Medicine Treatment:

Traditional   Chinese   Medicine   uses   various   body   and   mind   practices   such   as   acupuncture(needles placed  gently at ones skin), Cupping (Heated cups, placed on your skin that createsuction), herbs (Capsules from plants, teas, and powder), meditation (Sitting quietly and calmingyour mind), moxibustion (Those are dried herbs that are burned near your skin) and Tai Chiexercise (Involves slow movement and focusing on the breath (Wong, 2020). Acupuncture is amethod in which particular body points are stimulated by the use of thin needles through theskin. Acupuncture kindles the body to release natural painkillers, and it usually stimulates areasin the brain which are involved in processing pain. It helps ease chronic pains like low-back-pain, neck pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, andosteoarthritis pain. It also helps in minimizing tension headaches and acts to prevent migraineheadaches (Wong, 2020). Traditional Chinese Medicine sometimes uses herbal products to treatmany medical problems like stroke, mental disorders, heart disease, and some US citizens andother countries use them.

People have different perspectives  on the use of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Someprefer  it  since it   helps  address  conditions  like   allergies,  insomnia,  high  blood   pressure,  andfertility at low costs compared to the standard medications (Coghlan, Maker, & Crighton, 2015).However,   some   people   don't   prefer   it   due   to   beliefs   that   herbal   products   are   sometimescontaminated  with  undeclared  plants  or   animal  materials,  resulting  in  more  health   problemsinstead of treatment. Some people claim that during acupuncture, no sterile needles are evidentand may contract other diseases hence avoiding it.Some   of   the   barriers   to   Traditional   Chinese   Medicine   include   stiff   internationalcompetition   from   other   regions   who   offer   medicines   that   serve   the   same   purpose   moreeffectively with fewer health risks, as in the case of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Liu et al., .2016). The health risk might become a challenge to an individual completing the treatment.Scientific critics exist on whether Traditional Chinese Medicine is scientifically proved. Theyoppose by explaining that many explanations from traditional practitioners are not based on hardscientific evidence; hence, they oppose the treatment.In my opinion, I think this kind of alternative medicine is good especially when one isundergoing some stressful situations. But I would not advice taking herbs since sometimes theyaffect our bodies in one way or another. It is good we seek medical clarifications before usingthem.

Conclusion:

To some people Complementary and Alternative Medicine might provide unique perspectives into their lifestyles factors that may influence their health. There have been high quality clinical trials showing that alternative medicines can treat diseases, so it’s important for us not to self-treat in case of standard care.
