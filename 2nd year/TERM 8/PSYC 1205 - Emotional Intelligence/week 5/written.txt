Recall your MBTI profile and write a short description of who you are as a leader. Use your knowledge as of now—so, do not copy any earlier statements. Prepare a new description and note any changes or developments.

Describe how your learning of the two leadership tools, SCARF and NVC, can help you become the leader you want to be. Write a minimum of 500 words.

Assignment check list:

Did I allocate at least 1.5-2 hours to reflect upon and research the topic?
Did I look at my work critically? Do I know now which parts are great and which parts might be improved?
Does my text reflect the thoughtfulness that is being asked? Did I prepare the first and the second drafts? This means another hour or two—depending on your skills and speed. This also means: did I practice self-correction that is done by more reflection, re-reading and asking for help, if needed? Did I do that? How long did it take me?
Did I make sure that what I wrote is original and there is no copying and pasting involved?
Did I check my text for clarity and proper English?
Did I describe how the SCARF and NVC tools can help me become the leader I want to be? This doesn’t mean describing the tools—as all participants, as well as your professor, are very familiar with them, but rather, saying how you would use them in your own life. So, what this means is: did I answer the “how”, rather than the “what” question?
Did I write at least 500 words? Am I proud of all of these words?
Note: Be advised that the scoring grid will be based on the above points, and specifically points 3-7. Each point (3-7) will be worth 20%, so five points = 100%.

Good luck, but most of all, good work, because luck has little to do with the mark you will receive.


ANSWER:


My MBTI was ENFJ

According to the test that has already shown me that my personality is: ENFP
A hero is a person who has the ability to extrapolate, driven by values,
inspirational, social and very clear. The hero constantly launches his ideas to the
world as a way to attract attention to what is believed to be important, which
usually has to do with ethics or current events.
I do not know how to describe my personality far from boasting but I am really
satisﬁed with myself in general. I have a great ability to attract the attention of
people or issues that I believe in, using my social skills, I have great sincerity with
myself ﬁrst and with those around me II. I see in myself energy and positive.
Always spontaneous, loving to live, and very passionate. If I deepen my
academic knowledge about my character, I can say that my personality is open,
intuitive, emotional, and tolerant.
In my dealings with the outside world, I have two situations. The ﬁrst case is
internal where I use my intuition to take a position from objects around me. And
the other situation is external and through which I deal with the positions as I
believe and comply with my principles. Emotional "I see myself as a warm and
full of feelings.
I live my life in the form that pleases me and often I act on my nature. I do what I
believe to feel self-satisﬁed.
I need to concentrate on all the work I do so that I can ﬁnish my duties in a
satisfactory way and often need to be alone so I can concentrate on ﬁnishing my
duties.




I have a great ability to deal with people and I am able to pay great attention topeople and their feelings. I have a great ability to understand people's feelings,and also understand what they want and what they want, even if they do not.If I spoke more simplistically about the strengths and weaknesses of mypersonality, I could say that my most important strengths are

- I have good communication skills.- Pay much attention to people's ideas and motives.

- Catalyst, inspiring, I can take out the best people.- Has a sense of humor, sexy, optimistic, and active.

- In discussions, the discussion should end with the consent of the parties.

Weaknesses:

- Excessive enthusiasm may lead me to be unrealistic.

- I apologize to myself for this weakness, but unfortunately, I always have to dealwith bad relations even after my discovery.

- Quickly bored.According to my opinion, the most focused aspects for me that help me becomethe leader I want are:

For SCARF.

First: certainty

Where certainty is one of the most positive aspects of limiting access to disputesduring discussions.I think the idea of ##certainty is the most important idea I would like to follow inchanging or modifying my behavior. Because certainty in something makes mecalmer in discussions and thus a reﬂection of consciousness indirectly.So I would like to be absolutely certain of all the things that have been raised ordiscussed in my life.

The second aspect is: autonomy

I believe that autonomy is the ability to develop the ideas we need to have greatconﬁdence in ourselves and present it so that we can correctly present andapply it to ourselves ﬁrst and then to those around us.I see independence, through which I can achieve my happiness

According to NVC,

First: self-communication.

Since self-communication is the thoughts that go in my mind and my mind, it is also the voice of conscience within me, as it is a dialogue between mind and heart.
I know myself as the most self-connected person. In my personal life.
So self-communication often helps me to reach full satisfaction with my feelings
and to stimulate what is inside me always to reach full satisfaction with myself.


The second side: empathy


Empathy is the ability to understand, reactivate and respond to someone else's
experiences. I think I can often sympathize with others' ideas through
encouragement or support through harmony with that person's feelings. I can
not silence my feelings or hide my sympathies with anyone. I think that if we do
not activate or acknowledge our feelings, our lives will have no meaning. From
my point of view, denying someone's feelings, underestimating them or trying to
change them will not make those feelings disappear or seem less realistic than
they are; Emotions help to activate that person's credibility. It matters whether
we can not ﬁnd solutions. But we are able to listen, which helps to comfort the
other person.
