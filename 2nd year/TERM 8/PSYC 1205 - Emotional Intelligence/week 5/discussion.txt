Reflect on the usefulness of both of the tools. How would you apply the two tools in your daily life? Use two concrete examples for each tool (4 total examples). Be specific, concrete, and original (absolutely no copying and pasting). Emphasize your role, but do not forget that the tools have little meaning for only one of the individuals involved.

Your Discussion should be at least 250 words in length, but not more than 750 words. Use APA citations and references for the textbook and any other sources used.

ANSWER:


Firstly, The usefulness of both the SCARF and the NVC model cannot be underestimated especially as it relates to human-to-human relationship, be it in an organization or in our personal life.When one gets to fully grasp the varying makeup of the SCARF model and its 5 pillars, I believe it would be useful in fostering collaboration amongst persons of different personalities and background. As a leader one would find the SCARF model also very useful in influencing team members to get tasks done.On the other hand the NVC as a model of communication offers more empathy and understanding in communicating as leader or as person in general. Ensuring that one’s ability to relate and communicate with others is drastically improved if its tenets of Observation, Feeling, Need and Request are followed.Consequently, the ability of the SCARF model and the NVC model to drastically reduced conflicts in the work environment as well as in one’s personal space offers us the possibility of been better leaders and managers and or parents within our immediate environment.

Secondly, As a leader in my subgroup, reading about the approach and avoid responses of individuals have enlightened me to the reason why many persons who are naturally smart when be queried by those of higher authority begin to shiver and quake. As I read, I could literally imagine situations in which I myself have vowed never to go the offices of others who I senseto be a threat or just plain faultfinders.

With the knowledge of the approach and avoid response I should be able to as a leader try in minimizing the factors or social triggers activating the approach and avoid responses within those among my immediate cycle.Again, understanding that the human brain is hardwired to know for a certain the situation of things around him. With this knowledge gained I should be able to ensure clarity is continuously been offered via breaking down complex protocols into simple understandable formats.

The NVC on the other hand would be very applicable in dealing with individuals especially dissatisfied individuals. For instance having learnt that the cause of our feelings is not anotherperson, but rather our own thoughts, wants, and wishes. It would be wise of me to deal with the emotions as the NVC model prescribes rather than dealing with the person or the issues itself. This would be easily made possible by recapping what’s been said by the individual and ensuring clarity.Consequently, the NVC model would be used an applied in my own life by constantly revaluating my feelings and emotions whilst also trying to sort others out.
