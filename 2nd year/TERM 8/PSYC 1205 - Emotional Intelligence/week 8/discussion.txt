ANSWER:

For the past few weeks, doing this emotional intelligence course has sparked quite a bit of self-reflection and self-evaluation.  It has also helped me understand different personality types, how to relate to others, deal with stressful situations and build sustainable relationships.  According to Mindtools (n.d.), our ability to identify and appreciate our feelings and the impact our emotions have on others is emotional intelligence.


Conducting my SWOT analysis, I compared and contrasted my strengths and weaknesses, the opportunities present, and threats that could become obstacles. I learnt that while threats may sound all negative, they can serve as indicators of what's going on in our world and become motivational factors to improve. Doing my SWOT analysis revealed the following:


Strengths: Throughout my life, I have always set goals; one of my strengths is my determination to achieve them.  I also realize that my communication skills have been strengths that have allowed me to build sustainable relations and motivate others to reach their full potential.


Weaknesses: There are things that I realize need improvements, which include learning to say no and spending more time to take care of my personal needs. Making this adjustment would give me more time to relax and have more time to spend on the thing of greater importance.


Opportunities: If we take the time to reflect and become more self-aware, we would realize that there are many opportunities we could access.  I have discovered that your strengths can create substantial opportunities; hence, I am preparing myself.  While I seek higher education, I am ensuring that I seek and develop relationships that I can capitalize on in the near future.

Threats: What I thought was a strength I have discovered is a threat. I am always willing to put my personal agenda aside to help others pursue theirs.  I now realize that to progress, I have to correct this.

As I move forward, I will concentrate on self-regulation so that I do not make impulsive decisions.  According to Mindtools (n.d.), self-regulated people think before they act and have the ability to say no. I have been improving where empathy is concerned and find myself listening more and being too quick to judge.
