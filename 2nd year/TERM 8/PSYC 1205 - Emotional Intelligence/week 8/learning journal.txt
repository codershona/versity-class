ANSWER:


Reflection in general is very important in our lives because it helps us to measure our past and know how we can move on ahead with the present and the future. Looking back in whatever you have done in life, can either motivates you to change from bad or low performance to better performance. That is why I believe that looking or reflecting back in your life, can give youthe courage to strive and work harder for success.

Relating this to school academic will be the same importance for the students. Putting myself in the shoe, I can say that the course has really helped me to know many things that I never knew in my life. Even my level of thinking has been improved to another level where I can use my emotional intelligence and critical thinking in a positive way to analyze some cases or situations in my life.


However things that I learned in this term and they impacted me in a positive way are the “Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)”. The introduction of MBTI in my life has really impacted me and the tool really helped me to understand my behavior and the behavior of other people around me and I stand in a better position to understand my personality (INFJ) which I never knew before. So believe that this course has given so much to know. “Batool, B. F. (2013). Emotional intelligence and effective leadership, Journal of Business Studies Quarterly, 4(3),84-94”.


Another thing that I learned in this course is the importance of “Non Violent Communication (NVC)”. This is another important tool of skill that helped me to build my communication and how to relate myself with other people without using words that will affect hurt or make them feel bad. It is a very important tool when it comes to etiquette or language in general.


Another important tool is “Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, (SWOT)”. The SWOT analysis tool is very useful to me. It has helped me to overcome the fears, weaknesses and pushed me to believe more in myself. I always had the fear that “I cannot do it”. But the tool really motivated me and I overcame my fears and weaknesses.


I also got the chance to learn and understand how to give and receive a feedback. Feedback is very important because they help us to grow and improve ourselves. Therefore I was excited to receive feedback from my classmates because from there was able to know my strengths and weaknesses as well and I worked hard to achieve them.



I am profoundly sure that everything that I have learned is very important and I am going to apply them in my life.

Using the ENFJ in my life, I will apply it in such a way that I will understand the behavior, feelings and emotions of other people so that I will know how to go along with them. I believe itrequires special skills and positivity has to be the main pillar in achieving this.The NVC is another great tool which I am going to apply in my life to build my career so that I can fit anywhere I may go or any organization I may happen to work for. Using this tool in my lifewill help me to build my communication stronger and be in position of respecting other peoples’ opinion even though I disagree with them. Disagreeing with someone in something and puts it to the person in a respectful way is a good way of communication and that will be part of the way I am going to apply it in my life. Also giving a feedback to someone in the field ofwork in a way that he or she can accept it and be in the position of realizing their potentials and strengths build him or herself. 

Finally, using the SWOT Analysis tool will help me to manage myself in every area. The tool will help me to achieve my goals and objectives that I set in order to be successful. In the future, I may work for any company and I will have to apply this SWOT so that my goals and objectives will be achieved. Therefore using these tools mentioned above will sure help me to be successful in my life as a person.
