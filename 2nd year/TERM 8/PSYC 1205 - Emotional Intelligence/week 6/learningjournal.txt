Learning Journal Unit 6
Exercise Self-Talk in Peer Assessment: Building Self-Awareness

When?

To be done immediately following the peer scoring. Use the peer assessment that is due this week (from assignment done in week 5). You can also use any other peer assessment-related instance. Just inform your instructor if any other variation is needed.

Why do this exercise?

To raise self-awareness and learn better peer assessment-related skills (leadership skills).

How?

Note the thoughts you had while scoring the work of your peers. Pay special attention to any judgments and expressions carrying emotions. Not remembering what are judgments? Refer to your research on NVC as well as the manual on NVC provided in week 3. Note as many thoughts as you can. Do not worry about grammar. Pay attention to the content, not the form.

If your self-talk at this point is: I was focused exclusively on the task at hand and had no feelings or thoughts worth recording that were unrelated to scoring, please read the article on self-talk provided in the Reading Assignment, and return to this text afterward. Most likely you might be in self-denial, as we all do have comments and we all can improve. Contact your prof. if in doubt. Refer to your Learning Journal for the specific guidelines on how to do this exercise.

Refer to the most recent peer assessment, as described above.

Make sure you comment on how you felt, and what you thought.
Judgments about the writer included the following statements
Judgments about myself included the following statements
*Note: Judgments are different from observations. Judgments show our way of looking at something that is overly critical and not necessarily true. Observations are linked with true facts. Saying: “You were mad” is a judgment. Saying: “You pounded your fist on the desk for about 10 seconds” is an observation. Saying: “You are so smart” is a judgment. Saying: “The way you handled your friend showed compassion by…” is an observation.

Generic judgments including the following statements:
Any repeated thoughts or questions
I need to reflect on
Specifically
Based on the above, I need to work on changing the following beliefs that might not be true (or are worth to be challenged)
Anything needing more attention?
One belief that I want to challenge at this time
My plan on how to challenge my beliefs that might hinder my present peer scoring skills is:
Who will I contact to converse about these findings to help me learn?
Other comments in the process of self-talk (required)
What I learned this week (required).

The Learning Journal entry should be a minimum of 400 words and not more than 750 words. Use APA citations and references if you use ideas from the readings or other sources. 




ANSWER:


At the beginning of the week, I evaluated threeclassmates.I began to read the duty of my ﬁrst colleague, whoseproﬁle was A LEADER WITH AN ESFP PERSONALITYPROFILEMy evaluation was positive overall. I deserved to get90/90

My colleague's work was as complete and clear as hiswork translated into that great eﬀort by which hesought to link his ideas and deliver personalinformation in his own way.I liked his style very much and my ﬁnal comment was onmy colleague's duty (The student provided good work inhis own words and style, which describes his personalityas a leader in a smooth way with the concepts of hisorganization. I always wish him success.)In general, my assessment of the other colleagues is notvery diﬀerent, although my judgments are not exactlythe same but are very similar or similar.If I wanted to talk about myself more in the evaluationof my colleague. I do not think I exaggerated to give himthe full grade because I thought he deserved it already. Ialso always see in those around me that they aredeserving people.For he who has done the work, and strive for it, is agreat man. My comments in the duties of my classmates or in mywork and personal life are very similar and they areﬁlled with the positive and the motivation that makesthe person receiving the criticism able to show hiscreativity at work in the coming times. Because I see encouragement and thanks for good work makes hiswork in the next times work better, and the same idea Ioften used to practice with those around me.I am always impressed by the ideas of those around meand their opinions, no matter how ordinary and simple.I can not be a negative person in the right of any personwhether his work is negative or not. I do not likedestructive criticism and I do not like practicing it withpeople. It is totally rejected "for me.


And often when the work is not satisfactory to me ordoes not have the required quality ingredients often tryto be silent in the expression of my opinion so as not tobe a destructive person. I just say, "Bless God in yourwork."In general, I am always positive and I do not have theability to see the empty side of the cup.

I care a lot about creating something that makes thework valuable even if it does not have value. Becausewhen we look at the simple aspect of the work as agood work and carry the values we will give theemployer a strong motivation to see the great thing inhis work from our point of view and thus the person willstrive to work more before to reach the true grandeurthat was previously only an idea Simple andmotivational view we are made by our judgment onwork.I will not ignore the negatives in my personality that willcome from my colleagues' point of view by giving thingsmore valuable than truth and people. I am often aperson who is duped by people's intentions because Iclose my eyes completely to aspects that I do not like tosee in their personality.

But my view on this is the same because if we see everyaction, every person and every great statement will begreat. And if it is not great for all people, it is enough tobe in front of me. I am a great person with great wordsand a great job.
