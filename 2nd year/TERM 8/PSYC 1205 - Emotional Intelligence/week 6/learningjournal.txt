Learning Journal Unit 6
Exercise Self-Talk in Peer Assessment: Building Self-Awareness

When?

To be done immediately following the peer scoring. Use the peer assessment that is due this week (from assignment done in week 5). You can also use any other peer assessment-related instance. Just inform your instructor if any other variation is needed.

Why do this exercise?

To raise self-awareness and learn better peer assessment-related skills (leadership skills).

How?

Note the thoughts you had while scoring the work of your peers. Pay special attention to any judgments and expressions carrying emotions. Not remembering what are judgments? Refer to your research on NVC as well as the manual on NVC provided in week 3. Note as many thoughts as you can. Do not worry about grammar. Pay attention to the content, not the form.

If your self-talk at this point is: I was focused exclusively on the task at hand and had no feelings or thoughts worth recording that were unrelated to scoring, please read the article on self-talk provided in the Reading Assignment, and return to this text afterward. Most likely you might be in self-denial, as we all do have comments and we all can improve. Contact your prof. if in doubt. Refer to your Learning Journal for the specific guidelines on how to do this exercise.

Refer to the most recent peer assessment, as described above.

Make sure you comment on how you felt, and what you thought.
Judgments about the writer included the following statements
Judgments about myself included the following statements
*Note: Judgments are different from observations. Judgments show our way of looking at something that is overly critical and not necessarily true. Observations are linked with true facts. Saying: “You were mad” is a judgment. Saying: “You pounded your fist on the desk for about 10 seconds” is an observation. Saying: “You are so smart” is a judgment. Saying: “The way you handled your friend showed compassion by…” is an observation.

Generic judgments including the following statements:
Any repeated thoughts or questions
I need to reflect on
Specifically
Based on the above, I need to work on changing the following beliefs that might not be true (or are worth to be challenged)
Anything needing more attention?
One belief that I want to challenge at this time
My plan on how to challenge my beliefs that might hinder my present peer scoring skills is:
Who will I contact to converse about these findings to help me learn?
Other comments in the process of self-talk (required)
What I learned this week (required).

The Learning Journal entry should be a minimum of 400 words and not more than 750 words. Use APA citations and references if you use ideas from the readings or other sources.
