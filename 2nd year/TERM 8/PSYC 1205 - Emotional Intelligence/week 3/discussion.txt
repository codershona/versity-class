ANSWER:


There are many  strategies that a leader who is emotionally strong can follow as postulated byGoleman (1998) that the five components of Emotional Intelligence at Work are, Self-Awareness, Self-Regulation (or Management), Motivation, Empathy (Social Awareness), and Social Skills (Relationship Management). Among countless strategies I choose empathy (social awareness). I strongly believe that an emotionally intelligent leader are aware of their own emotions, and that of others. Through empathy, emotionally intelligent leaders are able to identify or perceive emotions. Thus I consider empathy as the best strategy as a leader when dealing emotions that encompass thinking and feeling. According to Batool (2013) for leaders having empathy is critical to managing a successful team or organization. Hence, leaders with empathy have the ability to put themselves in someone else’s situation. I am planning to use this strategy as a leader as it will greatly help me recognise the need to be rational and cognitive in my decisions, and responses , this will equip me with skills to be open to emotions even uncomfortable ones. Thus, empathy will give me a vital attribute of balancing , thinking and feeling which ensures better decisions forme and my followers.



Batool (2013) postulate that a leader must have the ability to communicate well with others and for the communication it is necessary to have the best listening skills. Thus, as a good   leader i  can inspire the loyalty of my  team  by giving them praises when it’s  worthy to showmy appreciation. Improving and learning how to effectively praise others is a good skill , but well worth the effort for people to recognise good communication  and leadership skills (Bass, 1985). Effective leaders tend to be expert in term of how they respond to work load, discipline, handle stress, communicate the goals of organizations by bringing innovation polishing the performance of their subordinates (Batool ,2013).

I am a leader who is highly democratic, I lead by delegating and helping my followers to realise their potential. I prefer delegating which ensures that I find strengths of others in my circle. One of my greatest strength is communication as echoed by Batool (2013) that a leadermust have the ability to communicate well with others and have the best listening skills. According to Gartenstein (2018) the main objective to be a leader is making the organization into a cohesive whole aimed at achieving its short and long-term goals thus unifying an organisation to follow similar gaols is my main objective as a leader.

In conclusion, leadership, communication  and emotional intelligence  are inseparable as said by Jim Rohn that “The challenge of leadership is to be strong, but not rude; be kind, but not weak; be bold, but not a bully; be thoughtful, but not lazy; be humble, but not timid; be proud, but not arrogant; have humour, but without folly.”
