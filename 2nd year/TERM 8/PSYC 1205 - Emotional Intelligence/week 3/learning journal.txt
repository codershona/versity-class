Ask your partner the following questions:
What is a positive attitude? To what extent do you have it? If you have a positive attitude, what actions might you display? How do you communicate it? What does a positive attitude “look” like to others? How do we differ in expressing our respective positive attitudes? How are we the same in expressing positivity?
What is a negative attitude? If you have a negative attitude, what actions might you display? How does your communication look like? What does a negative attitude “look” like to others?
How would you teach others to be more enthusiastic and motivated?
Which exercise from the NVC document would you choose to teach a group of people? Why?


ANSWER:


The partner I chose to be part of this week’s learning journal is a fellow peer Shirin Jamshidi. Shirin was the best option for me as she was my opposite personality type in
the working environment and we share the same personality type in our personal
capacity.
