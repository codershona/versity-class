Your response does not need to be a minimum word count as long as you fully answer the question.


ANSWER:


My chosen emotion that I would  like to improve would be tolerance. I will make a S.M.A.R.T. goal relatedto this emotion in hopes of addressing my character defects in building my emotions of tolerance. I will be referring to Performance and Planning (N.D.)

SPECIFIC:

This particular goal is specific because I would like to build my tolerance level for others timelines, mistakes, short comings, lack of planning and what I perceive as being thoughtless. I also would like to bemore tolerant of my own mistakes and short comings.The function that needs to be performed starts in the mind. It will be a thought process and the deletion of negative thoughts that arise when my timeline of getting to work, the gym, studying school and Spanish are put into jeopardy of being shifted in my daily timeline. What has to be done to achieve the deletion of negative thoughts is to be overly positive. I need to understand that everyone makes mistakes, that life is today with all of our actions and setbacks. I will remind myself that being intolerant of others is a very negative trait. I will replace any negative thoughts with two positive thoughts of the situation or person that the negative thoughts are directed towards. I will think of how I love that person or myself, how they or me is trying or how they might feel or what is going on with them to cause them to be late or side tracked.


MEASUABLE:

This goal will be a recurring 24 hour goal. It will be repeated daily starting over everyday until it is habit and routine to be able to achieve my goals and timelines, positive routines with love, kindness, understanding and tolerance.Limits and parameters are set. Everyday is a new chance to achieve this goal. Every 24 hours I have the opportunity to try again. I get another day everyday that I wake up to not make someone else or myself feel like a burden or bother. I get another chance to take the time with others and myself that is needed with an understanding heart.Results will be observable internally immediately through my stress level going down from pushing negative self-talk from my mind.

ATTAINABLE:

This goal is within reach because I have pushed other negative thoughts from my head for years at a timeto achieve certain degrees of peace.

The necessary skills are present for this goal and they come from the Christian Bible from the golden ruleto do unto others as I would have them do unto me. We all have dark and light inside of us and the one that grows is the one that we feed so it is important to push out the dark thoughts and embrace the good thoughts to allow them to grow.

RELEVANT:

I know this goal is relevant to the work that I need to perform because it is a struggle with myself and others. This goal will help my interations with others. It will effect y health in a positive and productive way.It is clearly linked to my school and job duties for grading myself and others, for for how I interact and view customers and co-workers. It will help me achieve objectives by developing a more cheerful and approachable personality.

TIMEFRAME:

I have set a 24 hour goal to repeat until it is habit.There is a clearly defined duration that ends and renews daily.The freguency with which work needs to be performed is clearly defined. It encompasses all interations with others and some thoughts about myself.
