ANSWER:

ANSWER 1:

Giving a definitive feedback was the biggest challenge for me because so often I don’t have words or thoughts about what I can say about the work presented to me as some looks similar to me but in a different way (in their own way), and I am limited to some advance grammars and vocabulary in attempt to provide a “sincere attempt to help the recipient improve his performance, behavior, understanding, relationships, or interpersonal skills.”, necessary to my peers (Section 4. Providing Corrective Feedback., n.d., para. 1). I understand that feedback is important to make improve in ourselves.

ANSWER 2:

My two strong points in providing feedbacks are: Short and straight forward, and just simple. After having read “Section 4. Providing Corrective Feedback” (n.d.) I can see why it is important to provide a somewhat not too lengthy feedbacks necessary for change. And change is not bad. It benefits both sides from a certain point of view. Therefore – the two points that I would like to work on are: preparing some words appropriate to construct a positive feedback, and sentences that are not too bias rather supportive in essences.

ANSWER 3:

I understand that “corrective feedback must be delivered in such a way and by such a person that it will be attended to, rather than simply arousing defensiveness, denial, or anger.” (Section 4. Providing Corrective Feedback, n.d., para. 3) With that said – of course, first, I intend to focus on myself as person with emotions because there were times where I view my feedbacks as criticism rather than as perception of in need of change. Second, I need to get my involved with acceptance which a crucial factor for change. And change my views of criticism into possibility for improvements.
