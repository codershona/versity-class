Abstract:

The world is rapidly changing, and the way that students are learning is evolving on a continuousbasis with online education replacing the traditional, in class face-to-face format. This change has beenexpedited due to the current pandemic, however, the improvement in technology over the last 10 yearshas played a significant part in addition to the number and quality of institutions now offering onlinecourses, not to mention the benefits associated with an online education. Based on current trends it islikely that the popularity of online courses will continue to increase and accelerate in the future. Theimportance of the internet and distance learning is a vital aspect of any country's higher education system,and that the wider benefits of an online education is clear, however, there are also some negativeconnotations associated with online education including the quality of courses, social isolation, limitedfeedback from online students, lack of interaction with fellow students and limited collaborative learning.The study examines some of the reasons why individuals would consider furthering their education andthe challenges they face. The information has been collected through a focused questionnaire, andtogether with other data analysed to drive the outcome results. The study found that there are keyconsiderations why individuals would want to further their education online including accreditation, costv. benefit and affordability.

Online education, love it or hate it, it's here to stay - educators in general have approached theidea of learning online or the concept of an online education with an element of scepticism and concernbut also with enthusiasm over the last 5 - 10 years especially as technology has developed. There areclearly benefits to learning online and an online education versus the traditional form of education and bythat I mean going to a physical classroom to be educated. It is important for you as an individual toconsider not only the benefits but also the drawbacks of an online education and by doing so you shouldbe better prepared and equipped to face the challenges it may bring.Historically, one of the maincriticisms of an online education has been centered around the lack of accreditation of a number of theseinstitutions that operated within the online learning space. We all have read at some point in time thehorror stories of these so called universities and colleges who used some of the funds raised fraudulentlyto fund terrorist activities and groups around the world. Let's not forget the 'lifestyle degrees' beingoffered by non regulated or accredited institutions but as the need for more flexible, cost effective andaccredited forms of education has developed there has been a significant improvement in the quality ofonline education and tertiary education which offers students accredited, value for money and overallgood quality education that can help them achieve their own personal goals and objectives. Furthermore itinstills a degree of self reliance especially given that an online education requires commitment anddiscipline.


As part of the research paper I completed a ten question questionnaire completed by ten peopleaged between 18 to 46+ years in age, all randomly selected to provide transparency with none of theindividuals known to each other utilizing the quantitative methodology. By undertaking this study, themajority of the participants as detailed within the section 'Questionnaire & participants' answers'considered the two key drivers of furthering their education as being; earning more money (60%) andgaining new skills (30%), when considering their personal circumstances 80% were either workingpart-time working or full-time students with only 10% currently not employed. The largest age group ofparticipants were in the 26 - 45 age range comprising 40% between 26 - 35 and 20% between 36 - 46.Furthermore, accreditation of an online institution, whether that be a college or university, is important to70% of the participants, and that costs/fees plus accreditation are also key to their consideration of whichonline college/university to join. Of the numbers surveyed 80% could afford to pay between $2,000 -$5,000 dollars per year towards college/university with the largest proportion able only to afford $2,000per year. Again, the largest percentage of participants (80%) felt that if they studied through an onlinecollege/university they would improve their career prospects in the longer-term. The number of hoursmost surveyed could allocate towards their online studies was 10 hours with the second highest being 15hours. All of the participants indicated that they have access to a laptop/device and the internet but 30% share their devices with others. Finally, the two key ways participants felt they learned were visually andreading/writing with audio & personal experience representing only 10% each. 


The results showed that across the age and employment range there are some clear aspects thatare important to individuals when they are considering furthering their education. Key considerationsinclude accreditation of the course and the college/university, costs involved and fees payable, and lastlyhow much they can afford to pay each year. Additionally, the majority felt that they could only allocate aset number of hours up to a maximum of 15 hours a week towards their studies and that all of theindividuals surveyed had access to a laptop or device to support their studies. Lastly, earning more moneyand learning new skills are fundamental to them studying. Overall, there are many students around theworld, including myself, that at a push could have gone to a traditional college or university, but thanks tothe UoPeople who through the use of technology has provided me, like so many, with affordable, flexible,and quality online education. They have made high-quality education accessible through the use oftechnology and ultimately electronic learning will help many people throughout the world obtainhigh-quality affordable degrees. My view is that the strategic partnerships formed by the UoPeople, inaddition to the knowledgeable and experienced educators who work with the university have cemented itsposition at the top of affordable, quality, and flexible online universities. Furthermore, there are alsosignificant library resources available to all students that are free, and let's not forget it has taken morethan 10 years for the university to become financially viable. 


Conclusion:

To wrap up, UoPeople is a fully accredited online institution utilizing open-source courseworkand peer-to-peer learning processes to deliver affordable and flexible courses without charging exorbitantuniversity fees. Additionally, it offers partial and full scholarships to those that are unable to pay or frompoor backgrounds. Even though there is no physical classroom there is still an expectation that studentsare in class,  participating in group discussions, and contributing to the education of fellow students.
