ANSWER:


Online Education - converting the sector one step at a time

University of the People 


Abstract:

The universe is unexpectedly changing; the way scholars gain knowledge is evolving continuously, with online schooling changing the traditional, in-class, face-to-face format.

Over the past ten years, the growth of a generation has added a widespread element to the wide choice of establishments now offering online courses, not to mention the benefits connected with online education. According to trends, the popularity of online guides will grow and receive a boost in the future. Although online education does have some advantages, it is also associated with some disadvantages, including poor quality courses, social isolation, lack of feedback from online students, and limited collaboration with colleagues. The significance of the net and distance learning is an essential element of any country's better training system, and the broader advantages of online training are clear. Researchers examined some of the reasons individuals consider furthering their education and the issues they face. The data has been amassed via a centered questionnaire and, collectively with different data, analyzed to power the results. Researchers found that there are main reasons people may choose to continue their education online, including accreditation, cost, benefit, and affordability.

Whether you find online training irresistible or hate it, it is necessary to stay tuned. Educators, in general, have approached the concept of studying online or the idea of online training with a degree of skepticism and concern. Also, the era has progressed over the past 5â€“10 years with enthusiasm. There are advantages to studying online and getting web schooling as opposed to the conventional form of training, and with the aid of that, I suggest going to an objective lecture room to become trained. Historically, one of the essential criticisms of online training has become a target because of the shortage of accreditation among a few establishments that perform in the online studying space. The horror stories about universities and faculties that used funds raised fraudulently to fund the illegal activities of terrorist groups have been read by all of us sooner or later in our lives. I believe we can no longer ignore the "way of life degrees" offered through institutions that aren't regulated or accredited. Despite this, there has been a lot of progress with online schooling and tertiary schooling that allows university students to obtain well-known, fee-for-service training and simple, tremendous training that would help them accomplish their goals and objectives. Furthermore, it nonetheless calls for a diploma of self-reliance, mainly because online training calls for dedication and discipline.




As part of the research paper, I completed a ten-question questionnaire completed by ten people aged between 18 to 46+ years of age, all randomly selected to provide transparency with none of the individuals known to each other utilizing the quantitative methodology. By undertaking this study, the majority of the participants as detailed within the section 'Questionnaire & participants' answers' considered the two key drivers of furthering their education as being; earning more money (60%) and gaining new skills (30%), when considering their personal circumstances 80% were either working part-time working or full-time students with only 10% currently not employed. The largest age group of participants were in the 26 - 45 age range comprising 40% between 26 - 35 and 20% between 36 - 46.Furthermore, accreditation of an online institution, whether that be a college or university, is important to70% of the participants, and that costs/fees plus accreditation are also key to their consideration of which online college/university to join. Of the numbers surveyed, 80% could afford to pay between $2,000 -$5,000 dollars per year towards college/university with the largest proportion able only to afford $2,000 per year. Again, the largest percentage of participants (80%) felt that if they studied through an online college/university they would improve their career prospects in the longer-term. The number of hours most surveyed could allocate towards their online studies was 10 hours, with the second highest being 15hours. All of the participants indicated that they have access to a laptop/device and the internet, but 30% share their devices with others. Finally, the two key ways participants felt they learned were visually and reading/writing with audio & personal experience representing only 10% each. 


The results showed that across the age and employment range there are some clear aspects that are important to individuals when they are considering furthering their education. Key considerations include accreditation of the course and the college/university, costs involved and fees payable, and lastly, how much they can afford to pay each year. Additionally, the majority felt that they could only allocate a set number of hours up to a maximum of 15 hours a week towards their studies and that all of the individuals surveyed had access to a laptop or device to support their studies. Lastly, earning more money and learning new skills are fundamental to them studying. Overall, there are many students around the world, including myself, that at a push could have gone to a traditional college or university, but thanks to the UoPeople who through the use of technology has provided me, like so many, with affordable, flexible, and quality online education. They have made high-quality education accessible through the use of technology and ultimately electronic learning will help many people throughout the world obtain high-quality, affordable degrees. My view is that the strategic partnerships formed by the UoPeople, in addition to the knowledgeable and experienced educators who work with the university, have cemented its position at the top of affordable, quality, and flexible online universities. Furthermore, there are also significant library resources available to all students that are free, and let's not forget, it has taken more than 10 years for the university to become financially viable. 


Conclusion:

To wrap up, UoPeople is a fully accredited online institution utilizing open-source coursework and peer-to-peer learning processes to deliver affordable and flexible courses without charging exorbitant university fees. Additionally, it offers partial and full scholarships to those that are unable to pay or from poor backgrounds. Even though there is no physical classroom, there is still an expectation that students are in class,  participating in group discussions, and contributing to the education of fellow students.
