Learning Journal Unit 7
This unit’s Learning Journal focuses on creating an Abstract for your own paper. Remember, keep your Abstract to under 250 words and keep it in APA format along with keywords listed at the end. This will be one of the final steps in creating your research paper. It is also the first thing a reader will see, so make the Abstract as strong as you can.

 In this assignment, state your thesis first and then your Abstract.

Your instructor will use the following rubric to grade your Learning Journal:


Aspect 1: Did the student write an Abstract?
Aspect 2: Does the abstract match the student’s paper?
Aspect 3: How complete is the abstract? Are there areas that need work?
Aspect 4: Is this a work of original thought? Has the student grasped what the direction the research should take in order to explore the thesis?
Aspect 5: Is the results section free from grammar and spelling errors? Are there repeating errors that can be pointed out?
