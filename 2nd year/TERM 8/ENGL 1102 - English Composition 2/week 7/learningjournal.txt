Learning Journal Unit 7
This unit’s Learning Journal focuses on creating an Abstract for your own paper. Remember, keep your Abstract to under 250 words and keep it in APA format along with keywords listed at the end. This will be one of the final steps in creating your research paper. It is also the first thing a reader will see, so make the Abstract as strong as you can.

 In this assignment, state your thesis first and then your Abstract.

Your instructor will use the following rubric to grade your Learning Journal:


Aspect 1: Did the student write an Abstract?
Aspect 2: Does the abstract match the student’s paper?
Aspect 3: How complete is the abstract? Are there areas that need work?
Aspect 4: Is this a work of original thought? Has the student grasped what the direction the research should take in order to explore the thesis?
Aspect 5: Is the results section free from grammar and spelling errors? Are there repeating errors that can be pointed out?



ANSWER:


Thesis Statement:

Effects of Social Media in Our Daily Life.

Abstract:


Social media has become an almost indispensable aspect of everyday life in today's culture, particularly among university students, who are avid users of the platform. Multitasking on social media has become more common as well. However, little is known about how university students use of social media and multitasking on social media affects their academic performance. The purpose of this study was to see if and how these two habits affect university students' academic performance. This study found that using social media for academic purposes was not a significant predictor of academic performance as measured by cumulative grade point average in a sample of undergraduate students at a university, whereas using social media for non-academic purposes (video gaming in particular) and social media multitasking were significantly negative predictors of academic performance.
