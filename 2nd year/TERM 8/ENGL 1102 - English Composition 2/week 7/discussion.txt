You read an abstract that you found for this weekâ€™s reading. What can you tell the class about the abstract? Is it in a style you would aim for when creating your own abstract? Does it have flaws? What would you change about the abstract you found?


ANSWER:

Women, Work and Stress: A Review and Agenda for the Future

To start with, this is our last week of unit 7 discussion for this week. Accordingly, I chose to study from a piece entitled "Women, Work, and Stress: A Review and Agenda for the Future," written by Mary Ann Haw. Therefore, the abstract summarized and expressed a general vision of the research paper. Women found themselves facing these challenges, along with stress, in their workplaces. If we want to talk about the proper solution, we can add that any company must arrange a healthy and well-balanced work environment. I imagine I would like to focus on this work style because it would build my abstract while working on my research paper. Also, I prefer the way it presents the details and concerns, including future clarification, by analyzing so that it would help to tackle the risks and develop advantages for women in the workplace. The abstract circulated positively and wonderfully, and the learning points fluently, and after analyzing the information, it was also perfectly connected.

To wrap up, I would not prefer to make any changes to the abstract, and the reason is that it has easy-to-understand keywords that express what the research paper wants to describe and discuss for its readers.
