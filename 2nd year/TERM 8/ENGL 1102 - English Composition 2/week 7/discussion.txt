You read an abstract that you found for this week’s reading. What can you tell the class about the abstract? Is it in a style you would aim for when creating your own abstract? Does it have flaws? What would you change about the abstract you found?


ANSWER:

Women, Work and Stress: A Review and Agenda for the Future


The abstract I read was from the journal article titled “Women, Work and Stress: A Review and Agenda for the Future” by Mary Ann Haw.The abstract indicates and the key points and general review of the research, which is about the challenges and the stress that women encounter in workplace, and the solutions to be provided to ensure a healthy and balanced working environment. I believe I would aim for this style when creating my own abstract during my research work, as I like how it presents the facts, concerns and potential solutions and research that may help reducing the risks and increasing the benefits of work environment for women. The abstract flows very well, the points read smoothly and information were connected very well based on how it analysis. I wouldn’t change anything in this abstract, as it has a clear key word and I got clear understanding on what the research is about and what it will discuss.
