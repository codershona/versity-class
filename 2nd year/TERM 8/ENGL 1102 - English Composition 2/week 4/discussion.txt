ANSWER:


As a South Asian, I read the speech of Thabo Mbeki’s Inaugural Address, when he
became the president of South Africa, succeeding the great Nelson Mandela. In his speech
President Mbeki spoke about the history of South Africa and the pain and suffering that was
brought upon black people when apartheid ruled the country He also speaks of hope and how
South Africa became a democratic nation, followed by the people of South Africa of all races
and colors being able to vote and establish a new era in the country’s history.

President Mbeki spoke about how he vows to continue the path of redemption for the people
of Africa, of whom so many still suffer from the lack of basic necessities such and food, water
and medicine. He also speaks of the alarming numbers of people that has fallen and continue to
be victims of violent crime and rape. This is a big focus point according to Mbeki and he feels
that he will not be at peace unless issues like these are not dealt with and improved upon
(Mbeki, 1999).

In conclusion Mbeki talks about the hope for Africa in general and how this continent has the
ability to grow if the focus on education is improved, particularly for the youths. South Africa
needs to form part of this success and it can if the nation forgets about the past and move
united into the future together, only then will success be obtained and the dream realized
(Mbeki, 1999).

What stood out for me in the speech was the recognition that South Africa has dark past, but
this is now being put in the past and as Africans we need to move forward. I don’t feel I know
the author better after reading this speech as this was a copy of the speech and no words of the
author were used.
