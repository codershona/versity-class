As a South Asian, I study Thabo Mbeki's inaugural address. He succeeded the awesome Nelson Mandela and became President of South Africa. In his speech, President Mbeki pointed out records of South Africa and the ache and the struggle that accompanied it. He was introduced to blacks whilst apartheid dominated the country. He additionally talks approximately desire and the way South Africa has to grow to be a democracy, accompanied by way means South Africans of all races and it heralds a brand new generation and country-wide records.

President Mbeki spoke about how he vows to preserve the route of redemption for citizens of Africa, of whom such a variety could be troubled with the aid of using the shortage of necessities such as food, water, and medicine.
