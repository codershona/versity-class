For this unit’s Written Assignment, you will utilize the UoPeople library to find 2-3 sources for your own research paper. You will then create a 2-3 paragraph Literature Review based upon your own analysis and synthesis of those sources. You grade will primarily focus on the use of your own ideas to group together your sources for your own research paper. Your ability to create and give credit via APA In-Text Citations and a Reference page is also a focus.

If you need an extra tip for this process, refer back to the University of Cumbria’s critical reading questions you have worked with in the past units.


ANSWER:

Literature review for my study paper on Eating Healthy

In her book, Lesica, (2017) talks about the challenges people experience with the knowledge of
knowing that you gain weight because they eat more calories than they burn, however even
with this knowledge it still happens and this can be attributed to many environmental factors in
the brain and body that contribute to this. Environmental mismatches is one of the biggest
causes for humans to eat more than what they require leading to weight gain.


Booker (2015) identifies food as one of humanities most elementary needs. He also identifies
the fact that people should focus on eating food that is produced locally and naturally, as this
has significant cost and health benefits. As an example, if people make a simple change such as
changing one days red meat consumption to that of eating fish, eggs or vegetables it could have
significant impacts on one own lifestyle as well as the environment.


So where do we start in improving our diets and the number of calories, we consume to ensure
a healthier lifestyle? Behavioral change is a good start and every one of us is unique because we
have different lifestyles and schedules. A good way to start a change in routine and clean up
your diet is to start by tracking what you eat. If you build a list of the foods, you consume you
can identify the healthy and unhealthy foods. Once you have identified this you can find the
replacement food to move to more healthy and clean food. An example of this would be to
change morning breakfast pastries and full cream mile coffee to granola with almond mile and
black coffee with honey as a sweetener. Another example would be to replace afternoon sweets
with a fruit or fruit salad. If we become aware of what we eat and we make incremental
changes we will quickly realize the benefits of more healthy living.
