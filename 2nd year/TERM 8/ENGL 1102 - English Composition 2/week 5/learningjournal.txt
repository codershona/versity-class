Learning Journal Unit 5
This unit’s Learning Journal focuses on creating a results section for your research paper. This section will include 2-3 paragraphs on your analysis of your own results from the research method you chose last week. These paragraphs will be based upon your own analysis and synthesis of those sources. You will want to include a brief explanation of what method you chose and why (Tip: You can use the information from last week for this part). Finally, you will determine what value your results are to your own study. Keep in mind that reliability and validity are not the same thing.

Remember: Not every experiment works the way you want—it is okay to admit that you made errors as long as you say what happened to cause the errors.

Your instructor will use the following rubric to grade your Learning Journal:

Aspect 1: Did the student’s results match the method used?

Aspect 2: How well did the student exhibit the results?

Aspect 3: Are the results something the student can use in his or her research paper as a means of exploring the thesis?

Aspect 4: Is this a work of original thought? Has the student grasped the direction the research should take in order to explore the thesis?

Aspect 5: How free of spelling and grammar issues is the results section? Are there repeating errors that can be pointed out?

I used the quantitative methodology in my research about the causes of nutritional deficiencies amongst pregnant women.

Quantitative research methodology; can also be a research technique that encompasses the goal dimension and additionally the statistical, mathematical, ornumerical evaluation of know-how collected through polls, questionnaires, and surveys using the pre-current computational method.
