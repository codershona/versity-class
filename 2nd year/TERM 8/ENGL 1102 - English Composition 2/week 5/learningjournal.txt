Learning Journal Unit 5
This unit’s Learning Journal focuses on creating a results section for your research paper. This section will include 2-3 paragraphs on your analysis of your own results from the research method you chose last week. These paragraphs will be based upon your own analysis and synthesis of those sources. You will want to include a brief explanation of what method you chose and why (Tip: You can use the information from last week for this part). Finally, you will determine what value your results are to your own study. Keep in mind that reliability and validity are not the same thing.

Remember: Not every experiment works the way you want—it is okay to admit that you made errors as long as you say what happened to cause the errors.

Your instructor will use the following rubric to grade your Learning Journal:

Aspect 1: Did the student’s results match the method used?

Aspect 2: How well did the student exhibit the results?

Aspect 3: Are the results something the student can use in his or her research paper as a means of exploring the thesis?

Aspect 4: Is this a work of original thought? Has the student grasped the direction the research should take in order to explore the thesis?

Aspect 5: How free of spelling and grammar issues is the results section? Are there repeating errors that can be pointed out?


ANSWER:

For this week’s assignment there was a few short stories to choose from, I choose the short story by Hunter S ThomsonI read the article by Frank Litsky and Lena Williams about “Many Sporting Events Called Off or Postponed”. Initially I did feel slightly intrigued to keep on reading, however they list a lot of sports teams that is playing and not playing on this article and because I myself is not a really big sports fan this information was not keeping my attention. I would skip over a few just because it seemed irrelevant to me personally. The short story, on the other hand was more interesting to me. Written by Hunter S Thomson it is about the 9/11 attack. I could relate to not only the authors’ viewpoints but also put myself in the situation and emphasize. It got to a point where I really wanted to know more and was captivated by the story. According to writingforward.com “A narrative can entertain, inform, and persuade — but most importantly, it can forge deep, meaningful, and lasting connections.” (Donavan, 2021)I would have to say that the narratives in this short story definitely kept me interested in reading more and trying to add my own opinion in my head of where I was during this event and how I can relate to the emotions the author must have felt while writing this.
