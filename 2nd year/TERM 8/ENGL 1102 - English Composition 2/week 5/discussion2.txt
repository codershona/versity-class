You read an article and a short story for this week’s reading. Which did you like better? Which kept your attention? Why? What does this tell you about the power of narrative?


ANSWER:


For this week’s discussion post, we have been tasked to read an article and a short story about one of the events that changed the world forever: The 9-11 terroristic attack. Even though both readings offer a description of the same event, I personally liked the story better, as its narrative and the author’s writing style are much closer to my tastes.

Written by Hunter Thompson (2001), the short story “Fear & Loathing in America” offers a more personal point of view of the 9-11 happenings. What caught my attention is the author’s writing style: not only he explains in detail what happens on that baleful day, he also adds personal details, such as the fact that he was “writing about sports” (Thompson, 2001, para. 1). Fear, anxiety,and uncertainty about the future are the main feelings conveyed in this story; indeed, the sentence “This is going to be a very expensive war, and Victory is not guaranteed” (Thompson, 2001, para.10) has stuck in my mind with such force that it will be hard to forget, especially considering how much the world has changed since that fateful day.

If we compare both readings, it is clear that narrative has a strong power in writing. Indeed, even if the journal article has described the same happenings, the way the message is conveyed is much more distant and makes me feel like that tragedy is not part of my life.Word Count: 241
