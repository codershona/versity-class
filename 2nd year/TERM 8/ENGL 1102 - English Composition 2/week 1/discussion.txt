This week, we will begin the class by creating a short bio of yourself and welcome each other to the class. To do this, just write a short (one paragraph) introduction that includes your name, why you want to be at the University of the People and what you expect from the course. MAKE SURE TO HAVE YOUR PROFILE PHOTO POSTED!  You can include more information if you wish, but the basic information should be covered.

Your professor will also include a paragraph for him/herself. We are doing this so each of us can see what a unique group of individuals we have and how we can all work together for a great semester.
