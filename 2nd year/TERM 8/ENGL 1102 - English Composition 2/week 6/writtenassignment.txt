It's become the most dynamic tool we use for learning, and it's also improving our modern educational system. In the 21st century, most people use this platform in every sector, like in the business sector and the government sector. But ICT has had an extraordinary effect on the training machine since all get-to-know sources may be discovered online. Our world is speedily moving into digital television or media, and we are getting all of our information using technology. If we want to achieve good quality and improvement in our education system without ICT, we cannot imagine it. Not only does ICT have a diversified impact on our higher education, but it is also developed for our future. Moreover, the paper argues the position of ICT in coaching and gaining knowledge and seeks to discover how this could affect how packages can be presented and added in the universities and faculties of the future.

Over the past 30 years, in the areas of banking, engineering, and architecture, ICT has greatly facilitated people's work. (Collis, 2002). After analyzing AEIMR (2016), they found that many students around the world were facing challenges in their teaching and learning systems. These challenges could be in any academic language, gender, class, or schooling background. Integrating ICT into our academic system has reformed the learning and teaching agenda.

Furthermore, ICT is bringing tools that are transforming our society through the way they are used. Besides this, it is also helping to shift our environment into a learning center. In addition, it has various formats like television, computer-based multi-media software, multicolored moving images, videos, etc. These tools can change our minds and views by stimulating them with good content. It would also assist any student to keep focused on their activities and motivate them to make their learning process more interesting. (AEIJMR, 2016).
