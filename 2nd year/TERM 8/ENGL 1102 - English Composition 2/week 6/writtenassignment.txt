ANSWER:

The position of ICT in better training for the twenty first century

Introduction:

Nowadays, technology means ICT. This short-form word abbreviation stands for Information and Communication Technologies. It's become the most dynamic tool we use for learning, and it's also improving our modern educational system. In the 21st century, most people use this platform in every sector, like the business sector and the government sector. But ICT has had an extraordinary effect on the training machine since discovering all sources of learn-to-know information online. Our world is speedily moving into digital television or media, and we are getting all of our data using technology. Unless we integrate ICT into our education system, we will not achieve the highest quality improvement. Not only does ICT have a diversified impact on our higher education, but it also develops for our future. Moreover, the paper argues the position of ICT in coaching and gaining knowledge and seeks to discover how this could affect how packages can be presented and added in the universities and faculties of the future.


Body:

ICT has been a driving force that has modified and stimulated much of our way of life. Further, in law or tourism, travel or health, information, and communications technology operate in these sectors to make them more modern. Over the past 30 years, in the areas of banking, engineering, and architecture, ICT has facilitated people's work. (Collis, 2002). After analyzing AEIMR (2016), they found that many students globally were having problems and challenges in their teaching and learning systems. These challenges could be in any academic language, gender, class, or schooling background. Integrating ICT into our classroom system has reformed the learning and teaching plan. 


Conclusion:

To wrap up, ICT will bring tools that create change in our society through their use. Besides this, it is also helping to shift our environment into a learning center. Besides, it has various formats like television, computer-based multi-media software, multi-colored moving images, videos, etc. These tools can change our minds and views by stimulating them with good content. Furthermore, it would motivate students to learn more by keeping them safe, focused on their work, and inspiring their minds. (AEIJMR, 2016).
