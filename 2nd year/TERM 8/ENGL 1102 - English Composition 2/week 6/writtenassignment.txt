This unitâ€™s Written Assignment focuses on creating a References page with all of the sources you use in your research paper. Copy and paste your thesis statement at the top of your page for the purpose of this assignment. Remember, places like www.bibme.org can help formulate this page if you need it.

Your page will be graded on keeping with the APA style, with the strength of your references (remember, peer reviewed references from the UoPeople or Google Scholar search are stronger than regular Google searches), and if the references you have actually fit into your thesis.
