Learning Journal Unit 6
For this unit’s Learning Journal you will need at least two sources. First, you will pick any short story or article found by using the UoPeople Library or another online source. The story does not have to be the one you've read for this week. You will then utilize the UoPeople library to find one source for the article or story you read. This can be anything from searching on the writers of the readings to the subject matter. You will then analyze the story or article, along with the source, in order to demonstrate synthesis. You will be graded upon original thought and how well you convey that thought in regards to the material gathered.


ANSWER:


I read an article titled “Legal ease? Do-it-yourself lawyering is not for everyone” written by Leslie E. Royal. This article is about being legal wise concerning a will. It where talks about Cheryl Collins-McLemore, only 37 years old but has decided to make her own Will. It provides information on what to consider when writing a will and to get proper advice so that nothing goes wrong. From this article we learn that not everyone can attain a lawyer when writing a will, some can write it on their own but it's important to get legal advice from top lawyers, and saving money is important. Leslie has written many articles teaching people to consider insurance, stay healthy, lightening one’s financial load, etc.

I found another article on the subject matter by the same author titled “If you have a will ...” These articles are interrelated. They provide valuable information on the importance of a will, what happens when you don’t have one etc. This article describes two kinds of directives namely “A living Will” and a healthcare proxy. According to Royal (2000) “The added advantage of registering your living will is that in the event of an emergency, information regarding your nearest relative or friend is provided on the registry” (para,7).I agree with the author on the fact that it is important to be financially wise and the benefits of a will. Though these articles are different they convey a deep massage concerning a Will.
