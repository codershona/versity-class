ANSWER:


Part 1:

Personally, I believe that society has undoubtedly done great and horrible things regarding influence on my point of view. I remember when I came to Malaysia 14 years ago; I abandoned everything because of life-threatening situations in Nigeria. When I got here, I recognized that people here don't like Africans; we are seen as a threat everywhere and it was the beginning of me having low self-esteem, I always felt that I didn't belong, I felt so indifferent for so many years at a point where I wasnâ€™t able to relate freely with the locals because I was afraid of being judged behind my back. Few Africans are involved in illegitimate activities, but the pressure on all Africans whether good or bad. Thank God, it decreased when I met a group of locals who were not racists; they respected me for the person I am and they had no prejudice towards me. I gradually generated courage in myself around the locals, which was a springboard for me.

Part 2:

Some people wanted me to conform to, was in fact to be attached to a particular perception or ideology. My tradition is far behind in their practice, way of thinking, views, etc. I am the sort of person who developed so quickly and was exposed to a civilized way of life; I affirm myself on the principles that have developed for myself, even though I am a Nigeria, but I do not have the same perception as a typical Nigerian who is back home. I used to have misunderstandings with my brothers because they don't like the way I think (having a mind of my own) back home, society, religious groups, tradition, etc. probably influenced us. In most cases, it becomes mandatory to comply with certain practices that I have freed myself from this belief. I helped myfamily understand the need to change and not be influenced by an external entity, but to understand certain life principles that will help them make a responsible decision about their lives.

IMPORTANCE OF ALTRUISM AND PRO-SOCIAL BEHAVIORS:

According to Williams, (2007) Altruism is the desire of humans to help others with no advantage, while pro-social behavior is the act of helping others, but primarily focused on social support. When we look at both aspects, they are almost similar, because we can see that the fundamental idea is to help others expecting no advantage.

Showing altruism and pro-social support behaviors are important in every society. People differ financially, physically, or psychologically. These differences make a difference in the way we accept services socially or economically. There are some people who can't support themselves because they have physical or mental disabilities. Some may also be vulnerable because of natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes. These people need the support of people who can support them, expecting nothing. As a result, altruism and pro-social support reinforce the spirit of support for the needy, I believe it is altruism and pro-social behavior are important because they can help to strengthen peace, democracy and help to serve people who are at risk and those who are sick or homeless. If we can instill altruism and pro-social support behaviors in the heart, we would not have hungry people because they are vulnerable or because of oppression by their leader or government.
