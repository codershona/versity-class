Part I – Our behaviors are influenced by society because we are parts of the society in which we live.  For most of us, we are born, we grow up, and live our lives in a society.  The norms and beliefs that are prevalent in society are parts of culture.

Please educate us about the role of “independence” and “interdependence” in your society and/or cultural psychology. 

a)     How does your society view independence and interdependence?

b)     What is the relationship of independence to interdependence (and vice versa)?

If you’re looking for definitions in the textbook, remember that the textbook is rooted in western psychology originating from western European beliefs and traditions.  Unless your family and society are rooted in western European traditions, for this assignment, please speak of your society’s psychology and/or cultural philosophy.  Let’s learn from each other’s psychologies!

 

Part II - Describe an experience or encounter you have had with the stigma attached to mental disorders* or unusual behavior.  Then explain how the situation was addressed.  Please explain also how you acted within that situation and how your actions are related to social influence.  If you were not satisfied with how things happened, explain how you would address that situation in the future.

*Please note that you are not being asked to diagnose someone; only registered professionals have the credentials to do that.  Thus, if the situation you are describing involves a condition that has been diagnosed by a mental health professional then you can mention that the condition was “diagnosed”.  Otherwise, if you are relating a story about someone who behaved in an ‘unusual’ manner, then simply state that the behavior seemed abnormal.  The point of this discussion is about the stigma and not necessarily about whether a diagnosis was conducted.  An official diagnosis, or lack thereof, is important only to provide context to the condition and to any related effects.

 

Your Discussion should be at least 250 words in length, but not more than 750 words. Use APA citations and references for the textbook and any other sources used.



ANSWER:

Part 1 :

Different cognitive representations of the self that people have are referred to as interdependent and independent self-construal. Those that take an interdependent perspective are more likely to be aware of others and their connections, and to modify their behavior to accommodate others. Independent individuals, on the other hand, are more concerned with their own well-being and the ability to influence others. Because our nation was previously an English colony, our culture considers them to be self-sufficient. We are self-assured, high achievers, self-reliant, and seek our own satisfaction. Most importantly, we decide and accomplish things for ourselves. We care for ourselves freely, which identifiesus and brings a sense of independence since we seek personal fulfillment and have own goals and beliefs.

However, we continue to rely on one another, making us interdependent, because, as the phrase goes, "no one is an island," by poet John Donne and we occasionally require assistance from others. We are still defined by our social roles, connections, norms, and circumstances and we value trusting relationship with others, satisfying social accountabilities, adjusting and fit in to crucial relationships, andadvancing the aims of others. Socializing together as a community, especially on special occasions such as this coming Christmas, is an essential event that is still performed in my society. Individuals in society express their opinions on many issues that touch them in some manner. They learn if their points of viewwere correct or incorrect based on the responses of others. This allows them to develop their ideas and build new and better solutions through the confluence of ideas.

Without interdependence, there can be no independence. Independence involves doing things on your own. While interdependence is relying on one another, No one is an island, yet we live in a world where we believe ourselves to be independent individuals, but there are some aspects or situations in our lives where we must rely on or require one another for our survival and the smooth operations and functioning of society. This is seen as one of life's cycles.


Part 2 :

Our mental health is influenced by our moral, mental, and social well-being. It influences how we think, feel, and react. It also has an impact on how we manage stress, engage with others, and make decisions. Mental health is essential at all stages of life, from infancy and adolescence through maturity. I have personal experience with people who have metal health issues(behavior seems abnormal) in my family. It arose as a technique of attempting to fit in with a specific group. As a result, she was pushed to utilize narcotics and had a mental collapse, necessitating years of treatment. I can speak to the fact that those who suffer from mental health issues are stigmatized. When she experienced a nervous breakdown, her colleagues found out and refused to cooperate with her. Her supervisor was forced to let her go.

As a result, she was out of work for a long period. Because they were humiliated by her situation, severalfamily members turned their backs on her. This caused her to become unhappy and worried, which led to him resuming her drug use. However, she eventually received the medical attention and familial support that she required, and she made the decision to quit using narcotics and begin taking the prescription. She has been off her medicine for almost 5 years and is now functioning as a regular member of society with her own family.

I can't truly hold anyone accountable for their actions. I believe some people respond in this manner out of fear and the stigma associated with mental health, finding it challenging for them to realize the issue.As a family member, I was there for her every step along the way, making sure she took her medication and went to her medical appointments. Since I told myself that it was my role as a family member. Being supportive was really beneficial, and she is still grateful to me for doing that for her while most run away.
