Part I.  Genetics and Epigenetics

Based on your readings, please explain how you think genetics and epigenetics affects:

·         us, as persons,

·         how we view and interact with others,

·         the kinds of perceptions and judgments we have about people, cultures, and populations, 

·         how public policy, government benefits, corporate structure, and other systemic structures can be changed (if needed), and

·         how our own values can change or be modified to make room for a new understanding of epigenetics

 

Part II.  Indigenous understanding of Genetics and Epigenetics

Studies in cultural psychology speak of "folk knowledge".  Much of these are oral traditions passed down through multiple generations and carry the beliefs, stories, and wisdom of previous generations.  One inherent understanding is that heritability that runs in families is not exclusive to the way we look but is extended to the way we act, think, and to how personalities develop.  The environment in which we develop is also important to many cultures and traditions.  The language used in indigenous psychology does not utilize scientific terms; they used their own terms to explain multi-generational and multi-dimensional inheritance (genetics and epigenetics).

·         Please describe how your culture explains heritability (genetics and epigenetics).  You can incorporate customary practices, beliefs, rituals, myths, and academic studies.
