Part I.  Genetics and Epigenetics

Based on your readings, please explain how you think genetics and epigenetics affects:

·         us, as persons,

·         how we view and interact with others,

·         the kinds of perceptions and judgments we have about people, cultures, and populations, 

·         how public policy, government benefits, corporate structure, and other systemic structures can be changed (if needed), and

·         how our own values can change or be modified to make room for a new understanding of epigenetics

 

Part II.  Indigenous understanding of Genetics and Epigenetics

Studies in cultural psychology speak of "folk knowledge".  Much of these are oral traditions passed down through multiple generations and carry the beliefs, stories, and wisdom of previous generations.  One inherent understanding is that heritability that runs in families is not exclusive to the way we look but is extended to the way we act, think, and to how personalities develop.  The environment in which we develop is also important to many cultures and traditions.  The language used in indigenous psychology does not utilize scientific terms; they used their own terms to explain multi-generational and multi-dimensional inheritance (genetics and epigenetics).

·         Please describe how your culture explains heritability (genetics and epigenetics).  You can incorporate customary practices, beliefs, rituals, myths, and academic studies.

 

Your Discussion should be at least 250 words in length, but not more than 750 words. Use APA citations and references for the textbook and any other sources used.



ANSWER:

Firstly, during looking to have a taken a observe and give you a greater descriptive definition of genetics; I describe it as "popular genetics and particularly genetic studies" (Winchester, A.M, n.d). This is a precise definition of genetics, however, a few psychologists and researchers were capable of providing a broader definition of genetics. Psychologists and researchers were reading genetics for decades to higher recognize the organic elements in the back of human behavior. Humans proportion comparable traits, however, there are numerous particular organic formations. For this reason, a few humans are thin, a few are tall, a few are hairy, and a few are bald. Some of those traits and behaviors are inherited from our mother and father and great-grandparents, even as others were mastered or discovered over the years. Understanding genetics, how they're organized, and their function in shaping our identity. Genetics tells us why we seem to like ourselves and why a few humans are greater prone to sure ailments than others. Like my family, I recognize sure knee pains that we begin to experience after a sure age, and it's been like this for generations.

We human beings are precise in each thing of our lives, whether we have interaction with every different or talk subjects that we're passionate about. Most of those behaviors shape through the years primarily based totally on several factors, including B. Take, for example, someone who spend his lifestyles in a completely rural village, including lifestyles revel in, study, and domestic schooling, all at once involves the metropolis, and unearths it tough to conform to the metropolis`s lifestyle. His view is absolutely extraordinary and a touch backward. But given the time for an excellent schooling and social revel in for the equal individual, he'll revel in an extrude in behavior. We are usually very short, to decide or criticize humans which have extraordinary perspectives as ours regularly by and large due to variations in tradition or upbringing now no longer knowing we're all shaped and constructed uniquely. Imagine the modifications a Nigerian moving to the UK for the primary time could undergo to comply with a brand-new manner of lifestyles. He could be substantially laid low with public policies, social structure and cultural modifications. Before beginning the diploma application at UoPeople, my values and lifestyles have been very extraordinary due to the fact the standard ordinary turned into visiting work, come again domestic and relaxing at the same time as catching up with my football. Matches and TV shows. However, it turned into finally changed to provide time for study. This is the riding pressure in the back of the understatement of epigenetics.

Secondly, I am from Chittagong in Bangladesh. Our local language is Bengali or Bangla. We Bengali consider recognizing for the elders. It has usually been proven withinside the manner we deal with elders. For instance, it's miles cultural to bow down whilst a female whilst a person greets an elder. This subculture is what we had been born with due to the fact it's miles a vital part of being an absolutely born Bangladeshi. Another instance is a Bangladeshi local-born to their own circle of relatives who's the parent of a masquerade called "Barhi" which means home in his local language. "In the Bangla subculture, an annual ritual to honor the lifeless facilitates to steady our ancestors the various dwelling people. We have our ancestors in our clan, town, or. We consider that we've got an obligation to earn a dwelling to uphold the moral requirements of the own circle of relatives beyond generations. Barhi is well known at a pageant called Barhi or Basha and owns a circle of relatives rituals with the aid of using the custom of masks. (" Wikipedia, nd, "Barhi (Home): Family: Bangladeshi Culture") Traditions and Upcoming Rituals. This may be classified as a clean evaluation of epigenetics with cultural ideals and multidimensional inheritance.
