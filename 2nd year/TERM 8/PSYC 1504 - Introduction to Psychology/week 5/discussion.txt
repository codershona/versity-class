PART I - In the chapter on sexual behavior, we learned that different cultures and countries view sexual orientation in various ways. For example, in some places, sexual orientation is viewed as a learned behavior that people have a choice over, and individuals are ostracized if their orientation or behavior is not the same as the majority’s behavior. In other areas, sexual orientation is considered a biological matter, implying that choice is not part of it. In other locations, sexual orientation is considered a mixture of biology and environment, where both influences are present
