ANSWER:



The Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER) (2019), defines mentalillness as a wide range of mental health conditions and disorders that affect the mood, thinking and behaviour. They indicate examples of mental illnesses to include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviours. In an effort to qualify the definition, they draw a line of demarcation between mental health concerns and mental illness, in which mental health concerns become mental illnesses when the ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect oneâ€™s ability to function normally (MFMER, 2019).

In my early days of learning about mental illness, I had a significant amount of preconceived thoughts about mental illness, based on the social orientation of my culture. I stigmatized mental illness and felt that people who were mentally ill, were less than normal human beings. In my uninformed mind, I believed that once people were diagnosed as mentally ill, that was the end of their lives and that there was no possibility of recovery. I was not aware that there were various forms of mental illnesses. I formulated this concept based on the fact that people who became mentally ill or who later became mentally ill after I had known them,were never specially cared for by their families, and often deteriorated to more degrading mental states than they initially were. Thus, I interpreted mental illness as the finality of a decent life. Many people who were mentally ill roamed the streets, naked, dirty, unkept and with matted hair, not having a bath for months. They slept on the sidewalks and were often teased or were feared by people in the various communities, especially children.


In addition to the countless people I knew who were mentally ill, I specifically recall a man who roamed the campus of my high school and were especially protected by the Sisters and other teachers. As the story unfolded, he was a former university lecturer, prior to him becoming mentally ill. The Sisters and other teachers who knew him before he became mentally ill would punish any students who attempted to tease or stone him, because they knew him in his days of success and professional career.


His behaviour was such that he would get a broom and sweep the leaves around the school compound, make up a wood fire and cook food in a metal tin. He also collected many leaves and placed them in his pocket. He would also throw small stones over the ravine to the other side of the bank. I thought his behaviour was weird, and I was very scared of him. When I graduated from high school, I left him there, so I am not aware of what happened to him, but I am assuming that the Sisters kept him there and maybe ensured that he was fed daily, and that none of the students interfered with him. By now, he might have passed away, as he was in his late fifties during my high school years.


During former years, in my society, mental illness is heavily stigmatized, even to the extent of stigmatizing their family members. They are labelled with names and often overdosed on strong psychotic drugs by the health care system.  Even though the stigma remains, I believe that people are becoming more informed about mental illness. Health education campaigns have brought on increased awareness about the various types of mental illnesses. The major mental health institutions have planned to release many of its patients back into the community, which made it necessary to educate the public and the family members of those to be released about mental illness and how they should care for and support their relatives in maintaining a stable mental and emotional condition.


The pathway to changing the stigma associated with mental illness is a very challenging one. However, I believe that knowledge is power, and based on that notion, if community members can be made aware of the scope and treatment for mental illness, more community support can be solicited in helping mentally ill people to access treatment and maintaining it. A lot of times, it is the inconsistency in taking their medications that causes mentally ill people to deteriorate or go into relapse. The lack of support and stigma creates embarrassment and hopelessness, which makes them lose interest in their personal care, even when they are at a level that they could better support themselves.

We can be a better resource for individuals that have a psychological disorder by being a friend to them and to their families. A friend in need is a friend indeed. We can organize community support groups of family members with mentally ill relatives. This support group can be able to talk through the challenges they face and how they can be overcome. We couldalso volunteer to work with the community mental health team in learning more about mentalhealth conditions, as well as volunteering to take these mentally ill people to special places ofactivities that they enjoy, which would stimulate their minds into happiness and help to improve their moods and mental condition. It may be very possible that a group of normal people working with the mentally ill, may help to bridge the gap between the stigma and normalizing them into society, especially if they have been institutionalized.
