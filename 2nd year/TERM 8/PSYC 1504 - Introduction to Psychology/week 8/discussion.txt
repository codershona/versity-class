Mental Illness is highly misunderstood. For example, there are some police officers that will mistreat an individual that is diagnosed with mental illness because they are not aware of their disability.  Others claim to have acted on horrendous acts (e.g., massacres) due to mental illness.

What were your previous thoughts about mental illness?

Have you met/encountered/heard of anyone with a mental health illness? Describe the event, how did you feel about their behavior, what happened to the individual? 

How is mental illness viewed in the media/society? What can we do, as a society, to change the stigma associated with mental illness and how can we become a better resource for individuals that have a psychological disorder?
