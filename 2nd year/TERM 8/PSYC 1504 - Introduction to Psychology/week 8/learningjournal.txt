Learning Journal Unit 8
In Chapter 16, Substance Abuse Disorders are discussed. Substance Abuse Disorders are prevalent in society.  Among the medical community, addiction is considered a chronic disease, but this concept seems difficult for some to understand or believe.  What is it about addiction, do you believe, that keeps it a taboo subject?  Depending on your socio-cultural background, you may have been brought up with certain beliefs about addicts and addiction.  Reflect on the dominant beliefs of your society. Do these beliefs stigmatize addicts?  How do the dominant beliefs in your society either help or hinder addicts from receiving treatment?   If you have some experience with someone that you know, consider what you've witnessed and offer your thoughts. 

The Learning Journal entry should be a minimum of 400 words and not more than 750 words. Use APA citations and references if you use ideas from the readings or other sources.


ANSWER:


Substance Abuse:

This   week's   topic   is   addiction,   which   is   described   as   not   being   able to   quit using   asubstance or engaging in a behaviour despite the fact that it is harmful to one's mentaland  physical   health.   When  someone develops   an   addiction, they use  a   substance   orparticipate in a compulsive behaviour that they will likely continue despite the negativeeffects (Spielman, et al., 2020). When compared to other chronic disorders, addiction ismedically treatable, and attempts to avoid it are successful.


Although  this condition exists, some people do not believe in  it.  Addiction is a crucialnotion in my culture because of its long-term detrimental influence on users, as well asthe multiple cautions society offers to anyone wanting to engage in addictive substancesor   activities.   The   most   common   sorts   of   addiction   are   smoking,   heavy   drugs,pornography, etc.

Drug misuse was shown to be frequent in 20%â€“40% of students and 20.9% of juveniles inNigeria. Heroin cocaine, cannabis, amphetamine, tramadol, diazepam, cough syrup, andcodeine   are   some   of   the   most   often   abused   drugs.   Abusers   get   their   narcotics   viapharmacies/patent   medicine   shops,   open   drug   markets,   drug   hawkers,   fellow   drugaddicts, friends, and drug pushers. Drug abuse is rampant among undergraduate andsecondary school students, teenagers, commercial bus drivers, farmers, and sex workers(Abubakar, et al., 2021).


Nigeria is a vastly diverse country, home to nearly 400 ethnic groups and a wide range ofreligious faiths. Drug use is considered in a broader context in Nigeria because of thecountry's multicultural heritage. The use of some substances that do not promote overtbehavioural   changes,   for   example,   is   not   considered   drug   abuse   in   most   societies.Despite the cosmopolitan nature of the Nigerian populace, the public, police, preachers,health professionals, schools, regulatory organizations, and parents have all expressedalarm over the country's expanding drug misuse burden.


Addicts  are  having  a harder   time opening  up   and seeking  help from society  or  closefriends and family. As a result, many would rather remain silent and suffer through theirproblems than face societal pressure, which would prevent them from receiving specialisthelp. In Nigeria, I had a friend who died as a result of heroin addiction some time ago. Itwas difficult to deal with him because he was addicted and refused to give up. We triedeverything we could to assist him stop using narcotics, but it was too late.

This study has considerably enhanced my knowledge and convinced me that addiction,like any other chronic disease, can be treated in the same way. It's lot easier for me nowto spread the word and persuade others that addiction is treatable.
