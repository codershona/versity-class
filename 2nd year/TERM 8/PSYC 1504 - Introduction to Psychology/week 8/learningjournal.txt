Learning Journal Unit 8
In Chapter 16, Substance Abuse Disorders are discussed. Substance Abuse Disorders are prevalent in society.  Among the medical community, addiction is considered a chronic disease, but this concept seems difficult for some to understand or believe.  What is it about addiction, do you believe, that keeps it a taboo subject?  Depending on your socio-cultural background, you may have been brought up with certain beliefs about addicts and addiction.  Reflect on the dominant beliefs of your society. Do these beliefs stigmatize addicts?  How do the dominant beliefs in your society either help or hinder addicts from receiving treatment?   If you have some experience with someone that you know, consider what you've witnessed and offer your thoughts. 

The Learning Journal entry should be a minimum of 400 words and not more than 750 words. Use APA citations and references if you use ideas from the readings or other sources.


ANSWER:


Substance Abuse:

This week's topic is addiction, which is described as not being able to quit using a substance or engaging in a behavior even though it is harmful to one's mental and physical health. When someone develops an addiction, they use a substance or participate in compulsive behavior that will likely continue despite the negative effects (Spielman, et al., 2020). When compared to other chronic disorders, addiction is medically treatable, and attempts to avoid it are successful.


Although this condition exists, some people do not believe in it.  Addiction is a crucial notion in my culture because of its long-term detrimental influence on users, as well as the multiple cautions society offers to anyone wanting to engage in addictive substances or activities. The most common types of addiction are smoking, heavy drugs, etc.

Drug misuse was shown to be common in 20%â€“40% of students and 20.9% of juveniles in Nigeria. Heroin, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, tramadol, diazepam, cough syrup, and codeine are some of the most commonly abused drugs. Abusers get their narcotics from pharmacies, patent medicine shops, open drug markets, drug hawkers, fellow people with substance use disorders, friends, and drug pushers. Substance use disorders are rampant among undergraduate and secondary school students, teenagers, commercial bus drivers, farmers, and sex workers (Abubakar, et al., 2021).


Nigeria is a vastly diverse country, home to nearly 400 ethnic groups and a wide range of religious faiths. Drug use is considered in a broader context in Nigeria because of the country's multicultural heritage. Using some substances that do not promote overt behavioral changes,   for example,   is not considered drug abuse in most societies. Despite the cosmopolitan nature of the Nigerian populace, the public, police, preachers, health professionals, schools, regulatory organizations, and parents have all expressed alarm over the country's expanding drug misuse burden.


Addicts are having a harder time opening up and seeking help from society or close friends and family. As a result, many would rather remain silent and suffer through their problems rather than face societal pressure, which would prevent them from receiving specialist help. In Nigeria, I had a friend who died because of heroin addiction some time ago. It was difficult to deal with him because he was addicted and refused to give up. We tried everything we could to help him stop using narcotics, but it was too late.

This study has considerably enhanced my knowledge and convinced me that addiction, like any other chronic disease, can be treated in the same way. It's a lot easier for me now to spread the word and persuade others that addiction is treatable.
