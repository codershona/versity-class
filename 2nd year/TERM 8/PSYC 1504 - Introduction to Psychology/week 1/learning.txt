Learning Journal Unit 1
The scientific method is a method of inquiry that helps us understand nature around and within us.  When we talk about “science” as only one way to explain nature, and psychology, in particular, as one way to explain human behavior, what do you think this means?  Can you think of other ways that we have used to explain behavior?

The Learning Journal entry should be a minimum of 400 words and not more than 750 words. Use APA citations and references if you use ideas from the readings or other sources.
