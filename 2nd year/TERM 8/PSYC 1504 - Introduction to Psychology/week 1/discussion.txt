Psychologists and scientists use the words “empirical evidence”, “empirical research “, and “empiricism” in ‘scientific studies’.  But do we, as consumers and users of ‘scientific information’ understand what these mean?

The Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2014) defines the word “empirical” as:

1:  originating in or based on observation or experience <empirical data>

2:  relying on experience or observation alone often without due regard for system and theory <an empirical basis for the theory>

3:  capable of being verified or disproved by observation or experiment <empirical laws>”

Answer the follow questions:

·         What parts of our bodies do we rely upon when gathering empirical evidence?

·         Would you consider your day to day living experience and observations as part of empirical evidence?  Why?

Your Discussion should be at least 250 words in length, but not more than 750 words. Use APA citations and references for the textbook and any other sources used.
