Part I - The most commonly known and labeled senses are sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell.  Considering this, please address the following

Do you think that there may be senses which do not necessarily receive information only from the environment, but rather from within us as well?  (For example, how do you sense that you are hungry?  If you hold your breath, which sense ‘senses’ that you need air? How do you sense the need for belonging?)

If you think that we may have more senses than the 5 noted above, would you provide your opinion on why you think the dominant scientific community may not have considered more than the typical 5 senses?  If you wish, you may use other references to strengthen or support your discussion.

How does a “definition”  (for example, how we define the 5 senses) help or hinder us in knowing the parameters of a concept, think about a concept’s potential for expansion, or keep a concept within known boundaries?
Do you think that the definition of sensation needs to be expanded? Why? 
 

Part II - What is the role of operant conditioning in our development of reading skills?  How do these skills become stronger and more “automatic”?  Do you think that many of our “skills” follow the same path of development, and why?
