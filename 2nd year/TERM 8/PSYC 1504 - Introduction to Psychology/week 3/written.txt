Part I - The most commonly known and labeled senses are sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell.  Considering this, please address the following

Do you think that there may be senses which do not necessarily receive information only from the environment, but rather from within us as well?  (For example, how do you sense that you are hungry?  If you hold your breath, which sense ‘senses’ that you need air? How do you sense the need for belonging?)

If you think that we may have more senses than the 5 noted above, would you provide your opinion on why you think the dominant scientific community may not have considered more than the typical 5 senses?  If you wish, you may use other references to strengthen or support your discussion.

How does a “definition”  (for example, how we define the 5 senses) help or hinder us in knowing the parameters of a concept, think about a concept’s potential for expansion, or keep a concept within known boundaries?
Do you think that the definition of sensation needs to be expanded? Why? 
 

Part II - What is the role of operant conditioning in our development of reading skills?  How do these skills become stronger and more “automatic”?  Do you think that many of our “skills” follow the same path of development, and why?

ANSWER:


Punishment is a term used in operant conditioning to refer to any change
that occurs after a behavior that reduces the likelihood that that behavior
will occur again in the future (Cherry, 2018). Some teaching methods can
be said to be positive or negative reinforcement.

Have you ever wondered why some people make use of punishment to
get their children to take on certain behaviors? There are many people
who are completely against spanking and shouting at children, to reduce
unwanted behaviors. I am also against it.


I believe children should be taught from a young age, that all actions have
consequences. If a child misbehaves, they should be punished and
corrected where they are wrong. For example, if a child had to sit in for
detention on a Friday afternoon, it would be a good idea for the parents to
take away his/her privileges in the household. These can include; using
the WiFi, going out with friends, and grounding the child. By doing this the
child will adopt the desired behavior (to do his homework on a regular
basis because he/she is scared the privileges will be taken away by his/her
parents). This method can be seen as positive reinforcement.


There are many examples where negative punishment is inappropriate.
Hitting a child can have serious implications for a child. This method of
punishment can affect the child’s self-esteem and it does not teach the
child any alternatives of the desired behavior.


There’s little evidence that spanking or other forms of physical discipline
are effective at reducing unwanted child behaviors, or encouraging
children to internalize — to really believe in — parents’ rules (George
College, 2016).
