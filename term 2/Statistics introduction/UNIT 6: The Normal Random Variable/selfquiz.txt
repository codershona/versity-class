According to some study, the height for Northern European adult males is normally distributed with an average of 181 centimeter and a standard deviation of 7.3 centimeter. Suppose such an adult male is randomly chosen. Let X be height of that person. The next 3 questions correspond to this information. The answer may be rounded up to 3 decimal places of the actual value.

The probability that the person is between 160 and 170 centimeters is


Answer:

0.0635,0.1093

Step-by-step explanation:

Given that according to some study, the height for Northern European adult males is normally distributed with an average of 181 centimeter and a standard deviation of 7.3 centimeter.

Suppose such an adult male is randomly chosen.

Let X be height of that person.

X is N*(171,7.3)

a) The probability that the person is between 160 and 170 centimeters is

=

Take any std normal table where prob are given from 0 to 3

Since symmetrical we take the prob for 1.51 and 2.88 and find the difference

= 0.4980-0.4345

=0.0635



2. The probability that the person is higher than 190 centimeter is

A: 
= 0.5-value corresponding to 1.23

= 0.5-0.3907

=0.1093




The middle 60% of heights fall between what two values?


A: c. (174.9, 187.1)

The distribution of X is Normal(181,(7.3)2). The central region that contains 60% ofthe distribution is the region between the 0.2-percentile and the 0.8-percentile>qnorm(0.2,181,7.3) [1] 174.8562 > qnorm(0.8,181,7.3) [1] 187.1438



Terri Vogel, an amateur motorcycle racer, averages 129.71 seconds per 2.5 mile lap (in a 7 lap race) with a standard deviation of 2.28 seconds . The distribution of her race times is normally distributed. We are interested in one of her randomly selected laps. The next 4 questions correspond to this information. The answer may be rounded up to 3 decimal places of the actual value:


The proportion (a number between 0 and 1) of her laps that are completed in less than 125 seconds is
Answer: 0.01942418

The distribution of a random lap is Normal(129.71,(2.28)2). The Probability of beingless or equal than 125 is> pnorm(125,129.71,2.28) [1] 0.01942418


The fastest 10% of her laps are completed under how many seconds?
Answer: 126.7881


The distribution of a random lap is Normal(129.71,(2.28)2). The fastest 10% of thelaps are completed under the 0.1-percentile of the given probability. This percentileis> qnorm(0.1,129.71,2.28) [1] 126.7881




The middle 90% of her laps are from a seconds to b seconds. Then a is equal to
Answer: 125.9597


The distribution of a random lap is Normal(129.71,(2.28)2). The central region thatcontains 90% is [a,b], where a is equal to the 0.05-percentile of the distribution>qnorm(0.05,129.71,2.28) [1] 125.9597
