Assignment Unit 8
Quizzes and graded assignments in MATH1280 are NOT group projects. Please
answer the questions and do not share the questions or answers with others or
accept advance access to questions or answers from others.
Estimating the Expectation
A measurement follows the normal distribution with a
standard deviation of 15 and an unknown expectation μ. You
can consider that measurement to be the "original"
distribution. Two statisticians propose two distinct ways to
estimate the unknown quantity μ with the aid of a sample of
size 36. They will do that by evaluating two different
SAMPLING DISTRIBUTIONS to determine which method is
better. There are two statisticians involved in this task:
statistician "A" and statistician "B." Statistician A proposes to
use the sampling distribution of the sample average as an
estimate. Statistician B proposes to use the sampling
distribution of the sample median instead. In order to choose
between the two options they agree to prefer the statistic that
has a smaller variance (with respect to the sampling
distribution). Tasks 1-9 refer to this problem of comparing the
two statistics to each other.
Normal Approximation of the Sampling Distribution of a Sum
Suppose that the expected number of phone calls that are handel by a switchboard
in each second is 5.35. Assume that the distribution of the number of phone calls
per second follows the Poisson distribution. Tasks 10-12 refer to this information.

Submitting the Assignment
For the assignment you should complete 12 tasks. Tasks 1-9
refer to the information associated with the estimating the
expectation and Tasks 10-12 refer to the application of the
Normal approximation of the sampling distribution of a sum.
This assignment has the format of a quiz and it is computer graded. The tasks are
described in the Form titled "Assignment Unit 8". The answer to each task involves
the selection of the right choice (in a multiple choice question) or the entering of a
numerical value at the designated location.
Notice: Unlike the Quizzes, you will not be given a chance to correct a wrong
answer after submitting the assignment. Hence, we recommend that you check
your answers carefully before submitting the assignment.
